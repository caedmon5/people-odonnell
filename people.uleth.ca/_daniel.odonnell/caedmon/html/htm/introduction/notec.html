&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>For most of the last two hundred years, scholarly interest in <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> has concentrated on the oral, folkloric and traditional Germanic aspects of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s story and oeuvre. The last forty years, however, have also seen the development of a body of work that attempts to explicate the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s formal structure in light of classical and medieval theories of numeric and geometric patterning. This approach has its origins in the case of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> in the work of Hupp&#x00E9; and Bloomfield (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HUPPE1968" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Hupp&#x00E9; 1968</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#BLOOMFIELD1962" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Bloomfield 1962</a>). Its most significant proponents in recent years have included Schwab and Howlett (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1972A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1972</a>, esp. 51-57; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 23-27; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1974" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1974</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1997</a>, 269-274). </p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>It is difficult to know what to make of this research. On the one hand, claims made by its proponents are often very subtle and, to modern eyes at least, occasionally strain credulity: very few interpretations depend on falsifiable observations or premises, and different scholars can end up using identical evidence to demonstrate opposing arguments&#x2014;or seemingly opposed evidence to arrive at identical conclusions. On the other, however, numerical and geometric patterns are undeniably part of medieval exegetical and compositional practice, and, as Curtius reminds us, suffer from many of the same problems associated with modern study of the phenomenon. This is true even when the authors in question explain the reasoning behind their compositions. Thus, for example, Walafrid Strabo shows a strong predilection for &#x201C;round&#x201D; numbers (numbers divisible by 5 or 10) in his Latin poetry&#x2014;a fact he comments upon at least twice himself (numbers 38 and 5, ed. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#DUMMLER1964" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">D&#x00FC;mmler 1964</a>, 2: 390 and 355; see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#CURTIUS1973" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Curtius 1973</a>, 506). An exception to this practice, however, is an 84 line poem addressed to Lothair (number 76, ed. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#DUMMLER1964" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">D&#x00FC;mmler 1964</a>, 2: 413-414). As Walafrid explains (lines 83-84), this length was determined by the age attained by the prophet Anna at the time of the birth of Christ (Luke 2:37), a biblical event otherwise unrelated to the contents of the poem. Had Walafrid not noted this fact, modern readers would most likely have considered the length of the poem to be a matter of chance. As Curtius notes (507),</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>[I]n Walafrid&#x2019;s poem 84 occurs as a number sanctified by being mentioned in the Bible, and if Anna had been 83 the Emperor would have received a poem of 83 lines. In this connection it should be noted that no symbolic religious meaning is inherent in Anna&#x2019;s age in itself. We may, however, assume that patristic Biblical allegoresis gave a moral interpretation to this number... but there is no inner relation between such an interpretation and the content of the poem. Walafrid has here used the &#x201C;Biblical number&#x201D; merely as an outer framework and stopping-point, just as elsewhere he uses round numbers.... </p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>C&#x00E6;dmon, unlike Walafrid, left no account of the numerical and geometric structures, if any, he observed in his composition. Certain patterns, however, do appear to be significant. Numerically, for example, multiples of three appear to have a structural importance&#x2014;perhaps indicating, as Howlett has argued, a Trinitarian interest on the part of the poet (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1997</a>, 269). Geometrically, the poem divides rhetorically into sections of four lines (on heavenly creation) and five lines (on earthly creation), a symbolic ratio that Schwab argues commonly was used in medieval exegesis and is found in two other early creation poems, the <span class="titlem">Carmen ad Deum</span> (<span class="titlem">Sancte Sator</span>) and the Old High German <span class="titlem">Wessobrunner Gebet</span> (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 24). The nominative singular pronoun <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">He</span></span> at the beginning of 5a may acquire extra symbolic prominence from its geometric location at the approximate middle of the poem (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 23; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1997</a>, 272). Finally, Schwab suggests that a series of symmetrically and concentrically arranged etymological cognates in the poem also may have a symbolic significance (25):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The literal repetitions which we find in the poem can hardly be due to the poet&#x2019;s lack of word-power: they also occur in symmetrical positions, being arranged in a concentric order:</p>
<p><img alt="Reproduction of diagram from Schwab 1983b, 25, showing arrangement of etymologically related words in C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn." src="ch3image2.png" /></p>

<p class="screenlink">(<a href="ch3image2.png" title="View image in separate window.">Image only.</a>)</p>
  
<p>If we assume that the central position is also one of special semantic importance, the message of this concentric structure would read: the Creator (lines 5 &#x002B; 6) is the eternal Lord (lines 4 &#x002B; 8) who is almighty (lines 2 &#x002B; 9)&#x2014;a dogmatic statement underlined and expressed by the systematic (and therefore &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D;) <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">ordo verborum</span>.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Whether or not these patterns point to the use of conscious numeric and geometric patterning on C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s part is difficult to determine in the absence of an explicit account of the principles of composition used.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.210" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.210" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.210" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>1<span class="hideme">]</span></a> For one thing, few of the patterns identified by scholars of the poem appear to reinforce each other. Howlett&#x2019;s observation that the pronoun <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">He</span></span> in 5a is the &#x201C;twenty-first of forty-two words and the forty-first of eighty-one syllables&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1997</a>, 272), for example, can also be understood as indicating that the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> as a whole does not have a single geometric centre<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.220" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.220" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.220" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>2<span class="hideme">]</span></a>: measured in syllables, the centre of the poem falls on <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">He</span></span> (5a); measured in words, the mid-point comes between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">He</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">aerist</span></span> (5a); measured in half-lines, it falls between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">scop</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eordu</span>/&#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">aelda</span></span> (5a-5b).<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.230" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.230" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.230" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>3<span class="hideme">]</span></a></p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Schwab&#x2019;s claims about the symmetrical and concentric arrangement of the etymological pairs in the poem show a similar difficulty. The pairs in question are separated from their neighbours by different intervals, rotate around different axes, and are arranged asymmetrically within the poem as a whole. The first element of the first pair, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">maecti</span></span>, 2a, is found thirteen syllables, six words, and two half-lines from the beginning of the poem; its etymological partner, the second half of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">allmectig</span></span>, 9b, constitutes the last two syllables of the last word. The interval between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">maecti</span></span>, 2a, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span></span>, 4a, the first elements of the first two etymological pairs in Schwab&#x2019;s schema, is sixteen syllables, nine words, and three half-lines; the second elements of the pairings, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span></span>, 8a, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">allmectig</span></span>, 9b, are separated by eleven syllables, six words, and two half-lines. </p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The geometric centres implied by these three sets of etymological pairs also are not the same. The first pair, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">maecti</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">allmectig</span></span>, 2a and 9b, are separated by sixty-three syllables, thirty-four words, and fourteen half-lines; their axis falls on the first syllable of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">barnum</span></span>, 5b, when measured in syllables, between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eordu</span>/&#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">aelda</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">barnum</span></span>, 5b, when measured in words, and between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">barnum</span></span>, 5b, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">heben</span></span>, 6a, when measured in half-lines. The second pairing, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, 4a and 8a, are separated by thirty syllables, sixteen words, and seven half-lines; their axis falls between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">heben</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">til</span></span>, 6a, when measured in syllables or words and on the verse <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">heben</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">til</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">hrofe</span></span> as a whole when measured in half-lines. Finally, the elements of the innermost pairing, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">scop</span></span>, 5a, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">sceppend</span></span>, 6b, are separated by eleven syllables, six words, two half-lines; their axis falls on the last syllable of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">heben</span></span>, 6a, when measured in syllables, between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">heben</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">til</span></span>, 6a, when measured in words and between <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">barnum</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">heben</span></span> (i.e. between 5b and 6a) when measured in half-lines.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.235" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.235" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.235" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>4<span class="hideme">]</span></a></p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The imprecision of these claims is significant only to the extent that such numerical and geometric analyses of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> are supposed to represent specific and precise principles of composition adhered to by C&#x00E6;dmon himself, in some cases in preference to other statistically demonstrable features of traditional Germanic metre.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.240" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.240" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.240" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>5<span class="hideme">]</span></a> While their arrangement is not precisely concentric and symmetrical, for example, the etymological pairings pointed to by Schwab do exist and are arranged approximately around the centre of the poem. They presumably have some structural or aesthetic importance, even if they do not all point to the same word, syllable, or half-line. Likewise, the arguments of Howlett and Schwab about the pronoun in 5a are supported to a certain extent by the structure of the surviving text: <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">He</span></span> is the first word of the middle line of the poem and it does mark the beginning of the several changes in the poem&#x2019;s structure and content: stylistically from the spare diction in the first part of the poem to the heavily ornamental poetic variation and repetition in the second (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ODONNELLFORTHCOMING" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Donnell 2004</a>); thematically from a concern with the theology of spiritual creation in the first four lines to an interest in temporal creation in the last five (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 24). While claims that the pronoun itself receives a special rhetorical emphasis are not supported by any metrical or syntactical evidence (<span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">He</span></span> appears both early in the clause and does not participate in the alliteration, both signs that it received low linguistic stress; see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#MOMMA1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Momma 1997</a>, 94-95), the pronoun is the only reference to God in a line that, unusually for <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>, contains no nominal epithet (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 23).</p>

<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The most convincing (and precise) evidence of numerical patterning in the poem involves the repeated use of multiples of three. While this pattern presumably would have been disturbed by the additional verses that Bede says C&#x00E6;dmon added to the original poem the morning after his dream, the use of the number three as a structural principle in the poem&#x2019;s initial performance is confirmed, uniquely, by the mutually reinforcing evidence of syllable, word, and line counts. The best witnesses to the poem&#x2019;s best recensions (the <a href="../edition/aelda/index.html" title="Link to critical text of the Nb aelda recension (separate document)." class="aelda">Northumbrian <span class="term">aelda</span></a> and <a href="../edition/eorthan/index.html" title="Link to critical text of the WS eor&#x00F0;an recension (separate document)." class="eorthan">West-Saxon <span class="term">eor&#x00F0;an</span> recension</a>s) all contain eighty-one syllables, forty-two words, and nine lines&#x2014;albeit with a slightly different distribution in each version. The same agreement is found, moreover, in the reconstruction of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s original <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> proposed, on different grounds, above (<a href="ch5.html" title="Link to chapter 5: Filiation and transmission (separate document).">Chapter 5: Filiation and transmission</a>). </p>

<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Even here, however, it is possible to find contradictory evidence. Howlett suggests, for example, that the poem also contains three sentences and &#x201C;names God nine times&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1974" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1974</a>, 7; also <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1997</a>, 269). To get nine epithets for God, however, he appears to be counting the noun phrase <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">allmectig</span></span> in 9b as two separate epithets&#x2014;in contrast to his practice with all other noun-adjective pairs in the poem, which are translated as single epithets: e.g. <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span>,</span> &#x201C;Eternal Lord,&#x201D; 4a and 8a, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">haleg</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">sceppend</span>,</span> &#x201C;Holy Creator,&#x201D; 6b. This practice may receive some authority from Bede&#x2019;s translation, which eliminates an equivalent to <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span> but retains, in <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">omnipotens,</span> a translation for <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">allmectig</span></span>. As I argue elsewhere, however, there is some evidence that the changes were made for metrical and aesthetic reasons (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ODONNELLFORTHCOMING" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Donnell 2004</a>; see also <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ORCHARD1996" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Orchard 1996</a>; &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="ch3.html#CH3.320" title="Link to referenced passage in chapter 3: C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn and Germanic convention (separate document).">3.35</a>, above), and there is no evidence to suggest that Old English could not place attributive adjectives after the nouns they modify (see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#MITCHELL1985A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Mitchell 1985a</a>, &#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A0;126-127). Likewise, Howlett&#x2019;s argument that the poem consists of &#x201C;three sentences&#x201D; is true only if one translates <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">sue</span></span> in 3b as an adverb (&#x201C;thus&#x201D;) instead of a causal conjunction (&#x201C;because, as&#x201D;).

The poem does divide into two sections of four and five lines respectively (unless, of course, one adopts Howlett&#x2019;s reading, in which 3b serves as the initial clause to the final section of the poem), and Schwab cites convincing evidence to suggest that these numbers were used in symbolic fashion to refer to the heavenly and temporal realms respectively (see esp. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 23-24; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1972A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1972</a>, 55-57). Following <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HENRY1966" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Henry 1966</a>, moreover, Schwab points to the existence of an <em>almost</em> regular pattern of syllabic chiasmus in the poem&#x2019;s construction (26)<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.247" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.247" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.247" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>10<span class="hideme">]</span></a>:</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>This passage is perhaps characteristic of the great strengths and weaknesses of numerical and geometric approaches to the text of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>. On the one hand, Schwab&#x2019;s argument is, if we assume C&#x00E6;dmon followed this line of thought himself, aesthetically attractive. It suggests that the poem works at a number of symbolic, allegorical and exegetical levels and helps explain some of the appeal C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s initial performance might have had for a biblical scholar and exegete of Bede&#x2019;s calibre. But the argument is based on material gathered to prove a different point (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HENRY1966" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Henry 1966</a> uses the correspondences to suggest the poem may owe a structural debt to traditional Celtic and Skaldic versification practices; see 211)<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.260" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.260" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.260" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>12<span class="hideme">]</span></a> and, in as much as it assumes that the apparent counter-evidence of the six-syllable 3b is in fact positive evidence that we are to read the poem in two different ways, is ultimately non-falsifiable. As the example of Walafrid Strabo suggests, such <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">ad hoc</span> readings of numerical and geometrical symbolism were not unknown in the Middle Ages&#x2014;but Walafrid explains what his principles are. In the case of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>, we lack not only an explicit, non-ambiguous, statement of the principles of composition used by C&#x00E6;dmon or recognized by his contemporary audience, but also, for most claims of numerical or geometrical patterns in the poem, confirming evidence from the text itself to suggest that such structures are not the result of pure chance.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.270" id="ref_NOTEC.NOTE.270" href="#note_NOTEC.NOTE.270" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>13<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Only in the case of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s use of multiples of three and, in the broadest terms, perhaps, its use of four and five as structural principles, does there seem to be compelling and for the most part consistent evidence that the patterns in question are an integral part of the poem&#x2019;s design. In most other cases, the lack of consistent evidence suggests verdicts ranging from &#x201C;not proven&#x201D; to &#x201C;not likely.&#x201D;</p>

As he notes in his introduction, &#x201C;Biblical Style&#x201D; is very precise and can operate at the level of the word, phrase, syllable, or letter (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HOWLETT1997" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Howlett 1997</a>, 19). The absence of a common geometric centre at most of these levels would therefore appear to be a strong indication that C&#x00E6;dmon was not working consciously to the proposed geometric compositional framework. Howlett&#x2019;s discussion of the structural importance of the number three is far better supported, however: as noted below, the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s syllable, word, and line counts all agree in being divisible by three.</p>
