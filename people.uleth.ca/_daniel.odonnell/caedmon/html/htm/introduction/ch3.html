&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The preceding chapters suggest that Bede was impressed by C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s skill as a poet and interested in demonstrating how unusual he was as a composer and performer. Although few modern scholars have shared Bede&#x2019;s enthusiasm for the intrinsic aesthetic quality of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s work, more have shown an interest in the question of his distinctiveness, arguing either that his poetry developed primarily out of (non-native) Christian traditions, or, more commonly, that his &#x201C;bold adaptation&#x201D; of pagan Germanic conventions to Christian ends marks the beginning of a new vernacular tradition in Old English and the other Germanic languages.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.005" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.005" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.005" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>1<span class="hideme">]</span></a></p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>As we shall see there is little evidence to support either claim. Structurally speaking, <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is a very Germanic poem. It shows a deep debt to the same major metrical, stylistic, and formulaic conventions found in other, mostly later, verse texts in Old English and other Germanic languages. Stylistically, there is little evidence to suggest that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse played the innovative role commonly assigned to it in modern literary histories. Bede nowhere suggests that C&#x00E6;dmon was known for his formulaic innovation, and C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s use of traditional Germanic epithets to describe the Christian God betrays no self-consciousness about his own supposedly seminal role in the development of native Christian poetry. In fact, the surviving contemporary evidence suggests that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse was valued primarily for the prosodic and formulaic skill with which it was composed. While Bede&#x2019;s account does suggest that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s training and methods of composition and performance were unusual, there is nothing in the <span class="titlem">Historia ecclesiastica</span> or the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> itself to suggest that the poet&#x2019;s actual verse was strikingly innovative.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Metrically, <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is an accomplished but very conservative poem. Its eighteen half-lines show four of the five major stress-patterns identified by Sievers and traditionally used to describe the most conservative Old English verse. Only Type C verses (i.e. verses showing the stress pattern <span class="stresspattern">&#x00D7;&#xF168;&#xF168;&#x00D7;</span>) are not found in the poem (in the following scansion, <span class="stresspattern">&#xF168;</span> indicates a &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; metrical lift, <span class="stresspattern">&#xF16B;&#x203F;&#x00D7;</span> a &#x201C;resolved&#x201D; lift, <span class="stresspattern">&#xF169;</span> a half-lift, <span class="stresspattern">&#x00D7;</span> a metrical drop, and <span class="stresspattern">(&#x00D7;)</span> a syllable to be ignored in scansion):</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span><span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> agrees well with one particular aspect of the distribution of verse types in the Anglo-Saxon poetic corpus: the use of a light Type A-3 verse for the poem&#x2019;s initial half-line. As Stanley notes, such light lines are a characteristic choice for the opening of Old English poems, particularly biblical paraphrases, prayers, and translations (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#STANLEY1987A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Stanley 1987a</a>, 128-129).

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>In a brief article, Robinson challenges this view, suggesting instead that the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s first word, the adverb <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">Nu</span></span>, might have received contrastive stress for rhetorical purposes (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROBINSONFC1993B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Robinson 1993b</a>, 118-119)<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.060" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.060" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.060" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>4<span class="hideme">]</span></a>:</p>
 <blockquote> 
<p><span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">N&#x016B;</span> [in <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>] means &#x201C;in this new Christian age.&#x201D; The familiar framework of the formulas of praise refers to the old heroic age that minted them; their Christian reshapings refer to the new age of Christianity. The introductory <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">N&#x016B;</span> establishes the relationship between the two: &#x201C;In the past we used these terms to praise men or pagan deities; <em>now</em> we must praise God with them.&#x201D; The freight of meaning borne by the adverb <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">n&#x016B;</span> being so heavy, I cannot think that it was submerged phonically in the murmur of a metrical dip. If any word in the poem must have logical and metrical emphasis, it would seem, it is this one.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>While this reading is attractive, it is probably beyond demonstration. In the first place, as Robinson notes, it depends on the assumption that <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> represents a bold Christianisation of traditional Germanic encomic poetry, &#x201C;a poetic form that seems to have been primal in many heroic cultures and that must have been one of the commonest forms practised by Anglo-Saxon <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">scopas</span> during their pre-Christian period&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROBINSONFC1993B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Robinson 1993b</a>, 117). Although an eulogistic tradition of some type does appear to be implied by classical accounts of continental Germanic customs, the genre itself, as Opland, Bessinger and others have noted, is not actually attested in Old English or other early cognate literatures, leaving us no body of contemporary material against which to compare C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poem (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OPLAND1980" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Opland 1980</a>, 98; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#BESSINGER1974" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Bessinger 1974</a>, 92; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LEHMANN1971" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lehmann 1971</a>, 24-29).</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>In the second place, the adverb <span class="foreign" lang="ANG">n&#x016B;</span> does not participate in the line&#x2019;s alliteration. As the alliteration of various forms of the demonstrative pronoun in <span class="titlem">Beowulf</span> in 197, 790, 806, and 1797 demonstrates, Anglo-Saxon poets could indicate rhetorical emphasis by allowing elements that are normally without metrical stress to participate in alliteration, either as part of the main alliteration, or, as frequently occurs with <span class="foreign" lang="ANG">n&#x016B;</span> elsewhere in the corpus, as part of a &#x201C;transverse&#x201D; or &#x201C;crossed&#x201D; pattern in which each stress in the on-verse alliterates on a different sound in the off-verse, e.g. <span class="titlem">Beowulf</span> 2053, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Nu her &#x00FE;ara banena<span class="caesura">&#x0020;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x0020;</span>byre nathwylces</span> (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#STANLEY1974" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Stanley 1974</a>, 142).<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.070" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.070" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.070" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>5<span class="hideme">]</span></a></p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Finally, as we shall see below (&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="ch3.html#CH3.270" title="Link to referenced passage in chapter 3: C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn and Germanic convention (separate document).">3.30</a>), the interpretation is not supported by Bede&#x2019;s discussion of the poem&#x2019;s initial performance and reception, which includes little to suggest that C&#x00E6;dmon was either the first Anglo-Saxon poet to compose Christian Old English verse, or that others found his poetry to be noteworthy for anything other than its exceptional quality, effectiveness, and, to a lesser extent, unusual method of inspiration.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>On the other hand, Robinson&#x2019;s suggestion may receive some support from Bede&#x2019;s paraphrase, which, as we shall see, ignores or provides unusual translations for several key terms in C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poem and may indicate that Bede found C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s terminology so innovative as to warrant suppression in much the same way Green has argued Wulfila suppressed similar vocabulary in his Gothic translation of the Bible (see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>, 278-279). Bede&#x2019;s &#x201C;suppression&#x201D; of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s epithets is itself quite uneven, however, and, as we shall see, can be explained perhaps better by reference to his desire to eliminate all syntactic apposition from his translation (&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH3.280" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.31</a>-<a href="#CH3.320" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.35</a>, below).</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The distribution of alliterating sounds in the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> also corresponds to standard Old English poetic practice. In the off-verse, alliteration is always found on the first stressed syllable and never on the second. In the on-verse alliteration falls on the first stressed syllable only or both the first and the second. There are no examples of crossed alliteration and relatively few lines showing double alliteration (in which both stresses in the on-verse alliterate with the first stress of the off-verse): in five lines, alliteration in the on-verse involves the first metrical stress only; in only four does it involve both. As Amos notes, this relatively low percentage of lines showing double alliteration is characteristic of all three externally datable Northumbrian poems, <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>, <span class="titlem">Bede&#x2019;s Death Song</span>, and the <span class="titlem">Leiden Riddle</span>. It probably represents a regional stylistic feature (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#AMOS1980" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Amos 1980</a>, 95-96).</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The very complexity of this system argues against its deliberateness. The rhymes indicated by Howlett&#x2019;s typography seem to involve a series of almost random correspondences. Howlett marks no rhymes in 1a, 2b, 3a-b, 5a-b, or 9a; the rhymes he does record vary greatly in significance and proximity (all spellings from Howlett&#x2019;s text): <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Uard</span>, 1b and 7b, rhymes with <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">middingard</span>, 7a; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Mehti</span>, 2a, rhymes with <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Allmehtig</span>, 9b; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Eci Dryctin</span> shows an identical rhyme in 4a and 8a; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">hefen</span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Sceppend</span> show double rhyme in 6a and 6b; and the inflectional ending in <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">astelid&#x00E6;</span>, 4b, rhymes with that of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">tiad&#x00E6;</span>, 8b (in light of the feminine rhyme in this last example, it is not clear why Howlett does not include two more examples: <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">herga</span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">Tha</span>, 1a and 7a, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">barnum</span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">firum</span>, 5b and 9a). While such correspondences may help give the text as a whole a sense of coherence (cf. the discussion of sound patterning in <span class="titlem">Kubla Khan</span> in <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#CRYSTAL1987" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Crystal 1987</a>, 74), so few of the rhymes appear at regular intervals or involve necessarily connected ideas that it is difficult to see how an Anglo-Saxon auditor would be able to perceive them as being of structural importance.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Stylistically, <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is probably most remarkable for its heavy use of ornamental poetic variation, particularly in the poem&#x2019;s last five lines.

<p class="noindent">Informally, the term &#x201C;variation&#x201D; is often extended to cover the repetition of similar words or the restatement of similar ideas or concepts, regardless of whether or not they stand in strict syntactic apposition (see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROBINSONFC1993A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Robinson 1993a</a>, 71-73).

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Regardless of the precise definition used, <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> shows a great amount of poetic variation. Rhetorically, as Schwab has noted, epithets for God occur in the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> at what approaches the maximum possible frequency: a noun, adjective, or pronoun referring to God the Father is found in every single line of the poem (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 23). Structurally, the poem can be divided into two major sections, each containing two clauses, of which the second can be read largely as an expansion of material in the first.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.090" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.090" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.090" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>7<span class="hideme">]</span></a> The poem&#x2019;s first four lines are used to state the theme, that men ought to worship God, and explain in general terms why this worship is due: <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">sue</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">he</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">uundra</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">gihuaes</span>, / &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span>, &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">or</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">astelid&#x00E6;</span></span>, &#x201C;as he, the eternal Lord, created the beginning of each of wonders&#x201D; (3b-4); the last five lines expand on this point by recounting the actual order in which the physical manifestation of these wonders was completed: first God created the heavens, then the earth for men. As Hupp&#x00E9;, Bloomfield, and Schwab have noted, this two-part structure echoes contemporary ideas about the dual nature of creation: a &#x201C;first&#x201D; creation in which God produced the eternal and spiritual ideal and a &#x201C;second&#x201D; in which the temporal and physical aspects of this original ideal were realised (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#HUPPE1968" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Hupp&#x00E9; 1968</a>, 129-131; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#BLOOMFIELD1962" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Bloomfield 1962</a>, 42-43; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SCHWAB1983B" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab 1983b</a>, 23).</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>In Robinson&#x2019;s stricter sense of the term, variation is confined almost entirely to the last five lines of the poem. As I have argued elsewhere (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ODONNELLFORTHCOMING" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Donnell 2004</a>), <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> changes tone significantly at the end of 4b. In the first four lines, the poem&#x2019;s theme and rationale are stated in a relatively spare and straightforward fashion: in the traditional reading (see &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH3.150" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.17</a> and n., above), the two clauses making up the first section show an adverbial relationship (the second clause explains why we should do as the first commands), have different subjects, and employ verbs that differ in sense, number, tense, and perhaps person. Even the numerous references to God in these lines are not strictly speaking syntactically apposite, but vary either in case or in their association with different aspects of the Godhead: the first epithet in the poem, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span>, &#x201C;Guardian,&#x201D; 1b, is accusative singular and refers to God the Father; the second, third, and fourth references, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">metud&#x00E6;s</span></span>, &#x201C;Creator,&#x201D; 2a, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">his</span></span>, 2b, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uuldurfadur</span></span>, &#x201C;Father of glory,&#x201D; 3a, are all genitive singular but modify nouns describing different parts of God&#x2019;s person and work. Indeed the only true example of syntactically apposite variation in the first four lines of the poem is found in 3b-4a, where the nominative singular pronoun <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">he</span></span>, 3b, and the nominative singular noun phrase <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, &#x201C;eternal Lord,&#x201D; 4a, have the same referent and serve as subjects for the same singular finite verb (in the following citation, loosely appositive forms are in italic type; strictly appositive terms are in bold; superscript letters are used to group apposite elements):</p>

As Fulk indicates, this highly formulaic structure and use of poetic language go together: many formulae make use of poetic words, and participation in common formulae is no doubt responsible for the preservation of otherwise archaic terminology in poetry long after such words have fallen out of colloquial use in prose (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#FULK1992" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Fulk 1992</a>, 265-268).</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The heavy use of poetic and formulaic diction in <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is significant for two reasons. In the first place, the poem is among the earliest recorded examples of sustained vernacular verse in any Germanic language (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#STANLEY1995" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Stanley 1995</a>, 139). While the evidence of later texts suggests that much of the poem&#x2019;s language belongs to a traditional poetic register, this traditional register is, in the case of several words and most if not all formulae, first attested in the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> itself.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.130" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.130" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.130" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>11<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Thus while most scholars assume that C&#x00E6;dmon is drawing on and adapting a pre-existing Anglo-Saxon poetic tradition in his work, his poem is also very often our earliest evidence of this tradition&#x2019;s existence.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.135" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.135" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.135" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>12<span class="hideme">]</span></a></p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>But the traditional poetic vocabulary and formulae of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> are significant for another reason as well: as Bede&#x2019;s account suggests and as the internal evidence of its Germanic vocabulary makes clear, C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poem, while one of the earliest attested examples of traditional Germanic poetry, is not itself directly representative of the earliest Germanic tradition. As a Christian poem, <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> by definition adapts, rather than seamlessly continues, the original pre-Christian tradition from which it presumably draws its vocabulary and formulae. This can be seen nowhere more clearly than in the poem&#x2019;s epithets for God. Two of the four terms for God in the last five lines of the poem, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, have their origins in pre-Christian Germanic lordship terminology (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#STANLEY1995" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Stanley 1995</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>); a third, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span>, is commonly used in a non-religious sense to describe a &#x201C;keeper&#x201D; or &#x201C;guardian.&#x201D; One of these terms, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, is attested for the first time in any Germanic language in <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>, 287); a second, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, is found earlier only in cognate form in Wulfila&#x2019;s Gothic translation of the Bible (the implication of <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>, 503).</p>

<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>This means that our earliest knowledge of these terms, and hence the formulae in which they are found, is from their secondary, metaphorical, usage in Christian poetry. In describing God as a <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span>, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, C&#x00E6;dmon is at best comparing the Christian deity to concepts traditionally applied to Germanic heroes and leaders; at worst, his terminology may consist of little more than dead metaphor, tags already so conventional as to be more or less drained of any symbolic force. Either way, neither the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> nor most of the subsequent Old English poetic tradition gives us direct access to the precise connotations this pre-Christian vocabulary may have had for early Anglo-Saxon audiences. As Stanley points out, only twenty-two of the approximately 15,500 occurrences of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> in the Old English corpus are intended in the secular sense of &#x201C;lord, ruler, chief&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#STANLEY1995" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Stanley 1995</a>, 138); a similarly effective Christianisation is also seen in the other Germanic languages. Green notes that most examples of traditional Germanic lordship and <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">comitatis</span> terms such as <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span> in the cognate languages survive in Christian contexts, in most cases, indeed, in contexts that can be traced to centres of Anglo-Saxon missionary work or influence (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>, 286-287).</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Traditionally, this Christianisation of traditional Germanic poetic language and formulae has been attributed directly to C&#x00E6;dmon and his &#x201C;school&#x201D; (e.g. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#STANLEY1995" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Stanley 1995</a>, 139-140; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROBINSONFC1985" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Robinson 1985</a>, esp. 30 n. 9). Most accounts of the poem&#x2019;s composition and reception assume, therefore, that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s initial audiences would have found his use of pre-Christian terms such as <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> daringly novel. As <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SMITHAH1978" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Smith 1978</a> suggests (15):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>...[I]n C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s time when Northumbria had been converted to Christianity for only half a century these phrases belonging to Christian poetry could scarcely have become conventional, as they certainly were in later Old English; on the contrary, the poem represents the beginnings of such a diction and its freshness and originality must have been felt a generation or more after its composition; no mere assembling of clich&#x00E9;s would have called for inspiration, divine or otherwise.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Whether C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse really had this effect on contemporary audiences is open to doubt, however. While the poem does contain some of the first recorded examples of presumably traditional Germanic terminology in the new non-traditional Christian sense, nothing in Bede&#x2019;s account of its initial reception, or indeed in the use of this terminology in the poem itself, suggests that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s text was valued primarily for the novelty of its diction. As we shall see below (&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH3.270" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.30</a>), Bede&#x2019;s own praise of the poem concentrates on its sweetness, order, and propagandistic value; the praise he puts more indirectly in the mouths of Hild and her counsellors is primarily concerned with its smoothness, propriety, and faithfulness to its sources. No one in Bede&#x2019;s chapter comments on C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s role in the Christianisation of previously pagan poetic diction; the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> itself applies its supposedly novel vocabulary without any obvious recognition of the freshness of its invocation of God as a traditional Germanic lord.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.140" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.140" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.140" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>13<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Opland has suggested that <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is important because it demonstrates how an Anglo-Saxon <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">scop</span> can be not &#x201C;the praise-poet of a lord, but... a praise-poet of the Lord&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OPLAND1980" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Opland 1980</a>, 116). It is difficult, however, to imagine a less vehement vehicle for such a message.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The strongest evidence against the traditional reading of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poem as a bold Christianisation of an earlier pagan Germanic tradition lies in the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> itself, which seems to show no recognition of its supposedly seminal function. <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is not the poem to turn to to discover what it is like to feel the loss of a recent pagan heritage or to exult in the recognition that the new religion can provide its adherents with heroes as significant and dynamic as those celebrated in the old songs. If C&#x00E6;dmon is responsible for introducing terms like <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span> in a religious sense, then he manages to rededicate this vocabulary with remarkable ease and lack of self-consciousness. He may describe God in terms appropriate to the Germanic hero, but nothing in his poem suggests that he is using these words in anything other than the stereotypical sense they acquire in later Old English Christian translations and prayers. His use of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> in 1b and 7b does contain some sense of &#x201C;protector&#x201D; or &#x201C;guardian.&#x201D; His description of God the Father as <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span> in 4a, 8a, and 9b, however, shows no evidence that C&#x00E6;dmon actually saw Him in terms of a traditional Germanic leader.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.150" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.150" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.150" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>14<span class="hideme">]</span></a></p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Just how little emphasis C&#x00E6;dmon places on the pre-Christian and Germanic connotations of the epithets he chooses can be seen when the poem is compared to two passages of approximately similar length from poems in which tension between pre-Christian and Christian world views is at issue. The Song of Creation in <span class="titlem">Beowulf</span> (ed. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#KIERNAN1999" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Kiernan 1999</a> [Edition]; trans. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#BRADLEY1982" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Bradley 1982</a>), a frequently mentioned analogue to <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> (see above, &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="ch2.html#CH2.310" title="Link to referenced passage in chapter 2: Sources and analogues (separate document).">2.31</a>), for example, uses the ambiguity inherent in Old English poetic diction and formulae to emphasise the distance between the full Christian knowledge of world history shared by the poet and his audience and the far more limited world view available to the pagan characters of his poem. This is particularly true of the Song&#x2019;s double ending: after a relatively orthodox account of creation in 92-98, Hro&#x00F0;gar&#x2019;s <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">scop</span> goes on to what a Christian audience would initially understand as a brief resume of prelapsarian life and the Miltonesque introduction of the <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">feond</span> responsible for bringing &#x201C;death into the world, and all our woe&#x201D;:</p>

<p>[T]he lyre&#x2019;s music was there, and the clear singing of the poet. He who was skilled in recounting the creation of men in time distant declared that the Almighty made the earth, a plain radiant to look upon which water encircles; he, taking delight in his achievement, established the sun and the moon, those luminaries, as light for those living in the world; he embellished the earth&#x2019;s surfaces with branches and with leaves; life too he created in each of those species which go their vital ways.</p>
 
<p>So the men of that community lived happily, blessedly, until one being, a fiend in torment, began to perpetrate outrages.</p>

<p class="noindent">As the next line of the poem, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">W&#x00E6;s se grimma g&#x00E6;st Grendel haten,</span> &#x201C;[t]hat savage visitor was called Grendel,&#x201D; indicates, however, this Christian view of the song&#x2019;s conclusion is, in the context of the poem&#x2019;s narrative at least, incorrect. The identification of Grendel as the <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">grimma g&#x00E6;st</span> makes it clear that the scop&#x2019;s song actually ended in 98, not 101, and that the happy retainers and the <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">feond on helle</span> of 99 through 101 are in fact part of the framing narrative. In forcing his audience to re-evaluate its understanding of the precise moment at which the song of Hro&#x00F0;gar&#x2019;s <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">scop</span> ends, the <span class="titlem">Beowulf</span> poet emphasises the distance between contemporary Christian understanding of world history, in which the significance of the underlying biblical history is recognised, and that of his pagan characters, who are doomed to repeat the original error unknowingly. As Robinson has argued in relation to other passages of the poem, this dual vision is part of a calculated effect whereby the poet allows his &#x201C;devoutly Christian audience&#x201D; to admire his pre-Christian heroes &#x201C;while remaining fully aware of their [i.e. the heroes&#x2019;] hopeless paganism&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROBINSONFC1985" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Robinson 1985</a>, 11).</p>

I quaked then, when the man embraced me; nonetheless I did not dare to collapse to the ground and fall to the surfaces of the earth, but I had to stand fast. I was reared up as a cross; I raised up the powerful King, Lord of the heavens. I did not dare to topple over.</p>
 </blockquote>
<p class="noindent">In this passage, only slightly longer than <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> and perhaps based on an originally contemporaneous text, Christ is portrayed in terms strongly reminiscent of those used by the Whitby poet for God the Father: he is described as the <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">frean mancynnes,</span> &#x201C;Lord of mankind,&#x201D; 33b; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">dryhten,</span> &#x201C;Lord,&#x201D; 35b; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">geong h&#x00E6;le&#x00F0;,</span> &#x201C;young man/hero,&#x201D; 39a; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">ricne cyning,</span> &#x201C;powerful King,&#x201D; 44b; and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">heofona Hlaford,</span> &#x201C;Lord of the heavens,&#x201D; 45a. But while the terminology is similar, the force of the language is completely different: the power of the passage in the <span class="titlem">Dream of the Rood</span> depends on our recognition of the double meanings inherent in the traditional poetic terms. Where C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> have little more metaphoric force than the relatively bland equivalents for <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">dominus</span> used by the Old English Psalter poet (see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GRIFFITH1991" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Griffith 1991</a>), the <span class="titlem">Dream of the Rood</span> poet&#x2019;s God is at once both <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">dominus</span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">miles</span>, a new Christian type of hero whose triumph lies in his ability to conquer by embracing apparent defeat. As Swanton argues (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SWANTON1970" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Swanton 1970</a>, 71):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Christ... [in the <span class="titlem">Dream of the Rood</span>] is not led... [to the place of crucifixion] by a jeering mob; he is stripped by no mocking soldiers. Instead, as in Ravennate iconography or as seen by Ambrose or Cynewulf, he is a young and confident champion striding from afar, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG">efstan elne mycle &#x00FE;&#x00E6;t he me wolde on gestigan</span> (34). Vigorous and single-minded, he strips himself for battle and a kingly victory. The action is entirely his, an eager sacrifice; there is no question at this point of his being nailed to the cross. Instead he climbs to embrace it (40-2). It is pre-eminently an act of dominant free will by a prince confident of victory. With the agony transferred to the cross, Christ can sensibly be seen to rule from the gallows.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The seeming lack of interest in the metaphorical force of the C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s vocabulary is echoed in Bede&#x2019;s paraphrase and account of its reception in the <span class="titlem">Historia ecclesiastica</span> (IV. 24 [ed. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#COLGRAVEANDMYNORS1969" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Colgrave and Mynors 1969</a>]). At no point in his chapter does Bede imply that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse was noteworthy for anything other than its metrical quality, organisation, and propagandistic success (see also <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ABRAHAM1992" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Abraham 1992</a>, 334). The chapter&#x2019;s opening lines suggest that Bede saw C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry as praiseworthy primarily because it was well constructed, scripturally based, never frivolous or impious, and very effective in leading men to turn their thoughts to heaven. His description of Hild and her counsellors likewise, portrays them as being struck more than anything by the poet&#x2019;s musicality and ability to translate accurately into well-formed verse. When they give him their first commission, it is for a translation of scripture or religious doctrine into <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">modulationem carminis</span>, &#x201C;metrical form.&#x201D; After they accept him into the monastery and set him on his programme of translation, they appear to be most impressed by his poetry&#x2019;s &#x201C;sweetness&#x201D;:</p>
<blockquote lang="LAT"> 
<p>[S]usceptumque in monasterium cum omnibus suis fratrum cohorti adsociauit, iussitque illum seriem sacrae historiae doceri. At ipse cuncta, quae audiendo discere poterat, rememorando secum et quasi mundum animal ruminando, in carmen dulcissimum conuertebat, suauiusque resonando doctores suos uicissim auditores sui faciebat.</p>
 </blockquote><blockquote> 
<p>She and all her people received him into the community of the brothers and ordered that he should be instructed in the whole course of sacred history. He learned all he could by listening to them and then, memorizing it and ruminating over it, like some clean animal chewing the cud, he turned it into the most melodious verse: and it sounded so sweet as he recited it that his teachers became in turn his audience.</p>

<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Slightly more ambiguous evidence is provided by Bede&#x2019;s paraphrase. As we have seen above (&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH3.180" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.20</a>-<a href="#CH3.220" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.24</a>), the epithets C&#x00E6;dmon uses in his original Old English are all relatively common in a religious sense in subsequent vernacular poetry. They are in the case of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> in particular, moreover, associated with stereotypical Latin translations. In Bede&#x2019;s paraphrase, however, the majority of these &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; epithets are either omitted or translated using Latin words carrying no sense of the original connotations. Thus <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, &#x201C;the standing term for <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">dominus</span>&#x201D; in the Germanic languages (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>, 298), is not translated in Bede&#x2019;s paraphrase using the expected equivalent. Instead it is paraphrased using <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Deus</span>, &#x201C;God,&#x201D; on its first occurrence in 4a and omitted altogether in the translation of 8a. The pre-Christian lordship term, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, 9b, similarly, is omitted in Bede&#x2019;s translation, which nevertheless retains the second word in the half-line, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">allmectig</span></span> (translated by <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">omnipotens</span>)&#x2014;an adjective which, Robinson demonstrates, was common in both pagan and Christian contexts (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROBINSONFC1985" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Robinson 1985</a>, 34-38). Only in the case of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> does Bede translate C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s traditional Germanic terminology using a Latin word with equivalent connotations, albeit even then on only one of the noun&#x2019;s two occurrences: in 7b he translates <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">moncynn&#x00E6;s</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> with <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Custos humani generis</span>, a paraphrase that retains the connotations of the original vernacular text quite closely; in 1b, however, Bede&#x2019;s translation of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">hefaenricaes</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> by <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">auctorem regni caelestis</span> abandons the sense of guardianship implicit in C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s original formulation.</p>

<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>There are several reasons why Bede might fail to translate C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s supposedly most novel epithets with either their stereotypical Latin equivalents or forms showing similarly striking connotations. One, implied by the traditional understanding of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s pioneering role in the Christianisation of Germanic poetic diction, is simply that the epithets themselves were too new, too unusual, and perhaps even too daring at the time Bede set to work (see above, &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH3.230" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.25</a>). In this view Bede avoids translating <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> or <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span> with a Latin term showing a similar sense of lordship either because the traditional equivalency between these words and Latin <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">dominus</span> had yet to be established or, because, like Bishop Wulfila who consistently avoids the cognate of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> (but not, interestingly, that of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>) in his Gothic translation of the Bible, he found the comparison too extreme for his intended readership (on Wulfila, see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#GREEN1965" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Green 1965</a>, esp. 265-269).</p>

<p><a name="CH3.300" id="CH3.300" /><span class="paragraphnumber">&#x00A7; 3.33 <span class="hideme">
<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>A second possibility, however, is simply that Bede did not consider C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s specific choice of epithets to be all that significant. In this view, Bede&#x2019;s failure to use what later material suggests to be the usual Latin translation for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s vocabulary comes not from any qualms about its novelty or suitability but rather Bede&#x2019;s sense that this diction was not a crucial aspect of the vernacular poem&#x2019;s success or structure.</p>

<p><a name="CH3.310" id="CH3.310" /><span class="paragraphnumber">&#x00A7; 3.34 <span class="hideme">
<!-- this span positions paragraph numbers in nonCSS browsers -->
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The first piece of evidence suggesting that this second possibility might be true lies in his treatment of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> in 1b and 7b. The fact that Bede uses a Latin equivalent with similar connotations to C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s original on one of the word&#x2019;s two occurrences demonstrates that he did not consider <em>this</em> form to be too bold for his intended audience; the fact he does not use similar Latin terms both times, however, suggests that he did not see its repetition in C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Old English to be particularly important to the poem&#x2019;s form or meaning. In this light, the omission of an equivalent for <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span> and the translation of <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span> as <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Deus</span> rather than <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Dominus</span> might as easily be a sign that Bede did not find C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s specific diction to be very important as evidence that he found it too bold.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The second piece of evidence suggesting that Bede was not overly concerned with C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s original vocabulary involves his treatment of poetic variation in the paraphrase. As I have argued elsewhere (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ODONNELLFORTHCOMING" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Donnell 2004</a>), Bede&#x2019;s translation, while treating C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s supposedly novel diction in an inconsistent fashion, pays extremely close attention to his use of appositive variation: in paraphrasing the text, Bede removes or rephrases every single example of repetition among syntactically apposite elements in the poem.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH3.NOTE.155" id="ref_CH3.NOTE.155" href="#note_CH3.NOTE.155" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>15<span class="hideme">]</span></a> This policy has its greatest effect in the last five lines, where C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s vernacular shows the most ornamental repetition (see &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH3.160" title="Link to associated location in this document.">3.18</a>, above). The original text&#x2019;s two, more-or-less synonymous verbs, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">scop</span></span> and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">tiad&#x00E6;</span></span>, are collapsed into a single Latin form, <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">creauit</span>. The five syntactically apposite nominative pronouns and noun phrases, likewise, are reduced to two-and-a-half: in translating 5 to 9, Bede retains the first nominative reference in each clause (<span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">he</span></span> [translated as <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">qui</span>], 5a; <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">uard</span></span> [translated as <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Custos</span>], 7b) but eliminates their poetic variants, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">haleg</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">sceppend</span></span>, 6b, <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">eci</span> &#x0020;<span class="chword" lang="ANG">dryctin</span></span>, 8a, and <span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">frea</span></span>, 9b. In contrast, Bede&#x2019;s translation of the first four lines of the poem renders C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s relatively spare Old English nearly word-for-word. The only exception comes in the equivalent to 3b through 4a, where, significantly, Bede recasts the vernacular text in order to eliminate the only example of ornamental syntactic apposition in the Old English poem&#x2019;s opening lines.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Bede&#x2019;s account of C&#x00E6;dmon is by far the most detailed contemporary non-fiction account of poetic practice to survive the Anglo-Saxon period. As Bede was not an eyewitness to the events he was recording, however, its greatest value to modern scholars lies in what it tells us about how C&#x00E6;dmon was understood by his near-contemporaries. Taken together, the evidence of the first two chapters suggests that, for Bede at least, C&#x00E6;dmon was a superbly accomplished vernacular poet who learned to sing in an unusual way. The evidence of this chapter, however, suggests that he was not in practice particularly aesthetically innovative. The evidence of the rest of the poetic corpus and cognate languages suggests that C&#x00E6;dmon was drawing on traditional Germanic language and forms in composing his <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>. But while the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> represents a secondary development of this (presumably originally pagan) tradition, there is no evidence to suggest that C&#x00E6;dmon was himself responsible for the initial adaptation of pagan terminology to Christian ends. C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse shows very little self-consciousness about its supposedly novel formulations for God; Bede does not devote any special attention to C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s use of formulae or poetic diction in either his translation or his account of the poem&#x2019;s initial reception. What Bede&#x2019;s account does suggest, however, is that C&#x00E6;dmon was a good technician. Bede&#x2019;s paraphrase of the original vernacular pays close if negative attention to the rendition of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s use of ornamental apposition; his description of the poem&#x2019;s initial composition and reception suggests that C&#x00E6;dmon was valued by his contemporaries for his skill as a versifier.</p>
