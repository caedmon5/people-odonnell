<p>&#x201C;Ab&#x012B;d ben al-Abras was a poor man with no possessions. One day he came with a small flock of sheep towards water. With him was his sister, Mawiyya. A man from the tribe of Malek ben Tha&#x2019;alaba confronted him and prevented him from leading his sheep to the water. Ab&#x012B;d went away saddened by this challenge. He came to a small bush under the shade of which he slept. His sister also slept under those trees. It is said that the man from Malek, who had confronted him, came upon them and accused Ab&#x012B;d of incest and expressed this accusation in three lines of poetry....</p>

<p>&#x201C;Ab&#x012B;d, hearing this, raised his hands to heaven in supplication saying: &#x2018;O God, this man has done me a terrible wrong with his false accusation. Avenge me, and help me overcome him.&#x2019;.... Ab&#x012B;d then went back to sleep. It is said that an apparition came to him in his sleep, with a big bundle of poems, which the apparition threw into Ab&#x012B;d&#x2019;s mouth saying, &#x2018;Recite this, for you shall be the most eleoquent [<span class="foreign" lang="LAT">sic</span>] poet in Arabia, the most glorious among the Arabs. Your poverty is the result of your generosity and kindness to your kith and kin.&#x2019; So Ab&#x012B;d woke up, extemporaneously reciting poetry against the tribe of Malek. His fame as a great poet continued to glow [<span class="foreign" lang="LAT">sic</span>] among his people from that time, recognized by everybody until he was killed&#x201D; (translation by Mohammed T.

<p>&#x201C;The most obvious parallel [to the biblical story of the annunciation and birth of Christ in the C&#x00E6;dmon story] is in the setting: C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s vision and Christ&#x2019;s birth both take place in a stable. Both Mary and C&#x00E6;dmon are visited, Mary by an angel, C&#x00E6;dmon by an unnamed &#x2018;somebody&#x2019; (&#x2018;quidam&#x2019;). Mary, a virgin, is puzzled by the news that she will bear a child; C&#x00E6;dmon seems perplexed that he should be asked to sing after leaving the feast precisely because he is unable to do so. In Mary&#x2019;s case, pregnancy follows a natural course, whereas in C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s, conception and delivery are, so to speak, one. To Mary&#x2019;s virginity corresponds C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s inexperience in composing and learning poems. Just as the gospel, in Matthew, states that sexual relations between Joseph and Mary were delayed (to say the least) until after Christ&#x2019;s birth, so C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s story stresses that his <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> and all subsequent works came into being through divine grace alone; that C&#x00E6;dmon had learnt nothing from the recitations of his fellows, despite his exposure to them. He was thus as pure in his way as Mary was in hers, and no more open to the charge of having rooted Christian English poetry in pagan soil than Mary is of having borne Joseph&#x2019;s son&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ORTON1983" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Orton 1983</a>, 165-166).</p>

<p>&#x201C;At a formal ceremonial occasion like the banquet scenes in lines 612-64 and 1228-31 of <span class="titlem">Beowulf</span>, a splendid cup might be passed around, with each person who receives it expected to make some sort of formal declaration, perhaps either praise for a king or hero or a heroic oath.... Despite the lack of evidence in Bede&#x2019;s sober text, I think that elderly Caedmon might have found himself at such a party, and foreseen the jovial group turning to look at him, when he knew himself incapable of taking his turn as the situation demanded&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OSBORN1989" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Osborn 1989</a>, 16).</p>

<p>Gregory recounts the following story in his <span class="titlem">Dialogues</span> (IV. 26): &#x201C;[A] certain boy fell into a trance and received the gift of speaking strange languages.

<p>Cennfaeled mac Ailella was a mid seventh-century ecclesiastic of aristocratic origin who was wounded at the battle of Magh Rath (c. 637) and removed to Tuaim Drecain to be healed. In the course of his treatment, Cennfaeled had his <span class="foreign" lang="SGA">ichinn dermait,</span> &#x201C;brain of forgetting,&#x201D; removed, leaving him with a prodigious memory (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#IRELAND1986" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Ireland 1986</a>, 113). He then began a course of study in which he was taught &#x201C;lore of <span class="foreign" lang="SGA">l&#x00E9;gend</span> (ecclesiastical learning), <span class="foreign" lang="SGA">f&#x00E9;nechas</span> (native law), and <span class="foreign" lang="SGA">filidecht</span> (native poetics and general literary, pseudo-historical, and topographical tradition)&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#DUMVILLE1981" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Dumville 1981</a>, 147). Because of his excellent memory, Cennfaeled was able to learn each day&#x2019;s lesson by heart and &#x201C;put a &#x2018;fine thread of poetry&#x2019;&#x201D; around it before writing it out on tablets and subsequently transcribing it into codices; he is said to have left &#x201C;a &#x2018;large number of well composed books&#x2019; after him&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#DUMVILLE1981" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Dumville 1981</a>, 147).</p>

<p>Chippewa dream songs are composed &#x201C;during a dream or on waking from a dream&#x201D; (Frances Densmore, quoted in <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#POUND1929" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Pound 1929</a>, 237):</p>

<p>&#x201C;The story of one song... is that when the composer was a boy he had a dream, and in his dream he heard the trees singing as though they were alive. When he awoke he made up the song, in which he repeats what he heard the trees say. Another youth heard the crows in the trees and imagined he learned his song from them. The song was first a dream song and then a war-dance song&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#POUND1929" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Pound 1929</a>, 237).</p>

<p>Colm&#x00E1;n mac L&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;ni (<span class="foreign" lang="LAT">ob.</span> <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">c.</span> 600) was a professional poet before he became a monk.

<p>&#x201C;A[n]... oblique reference in Old English verse to the... theme of pious poetic inspiration, and to circumstances similar to those in which C&#x00E6;dmon found himself, appears in the course of the lengthy (and Latinate) rhyming passage which occurs towards the end of <span class="titlem">Elene</span> (lines 1236-51), where an aged man (in this case Cynewulf) claims to have been inspired to song, after a long period of night-time contemplation, by God, who has &#x2018;unlocked&#x2019; his song-craft&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ORCHARD1996" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Orchard 1996</a>, 410-411).</p>

<p>&#x201C;After compline and pious devotion one night, Dunstan in sleep was rapt to heaven. There he saw his own mother joined in marriage to a mighty king amid great rejoicing. From all sides rose hymns and music. While Dunstan listened in delight and attended with all his heart to what was going on, a young man clad in white brilliance came up to him and said: &#x2018;When you see and hear these choirs in jubilation, why do you not join it?&#x2019; Dunstan replied that he did not know what to sing in honour of so great a king. So the young man taught him the antiphon, <span class="titlem">O rex gentium</span>. In his vision Dunstan repeated the antiphon many times and in the morning, when he had risen from sleep, had it copied down lest it pass out of memory&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SHEPHERD1954" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Shepherd 1954</a>, 114).</p>

<p>Egil is already an accomplished poet. Trapped in York and threatened with death by Erik Bloodaxe, Egil is persuaded by his friend Arijbjo&#x0345;rn to compose a poem in Erik&#x2019;s honour, in the hope that this will convince him to spare his life. Egil&#x2019;s attempts are frustrated, however, by a magical swallow that prevents him from composing by singing at his window. When Arijbjo&#x0345;rn investigates, the bird flies away, allowing Egil to compose his song.</p>

<p>Dream or sleep inspiration plays a role in the work of several English Romantic poets. Examples cited by Pound include Young (&#x201C;Night Thoughts&#x201D;), Coleridge (<span class="titlem">Kubla Khan</span>), and Keats (&#x201C;Sleep and Poetry&#x201D;).

<p>Gregory recounts the following story in his <span class="titlem">Dialogues</span> (I. 4): &#x201C;A certain Equitius, although not in holy orders, nevertheless preached to many at various places. When he was questioned, he gave the explanation that a young man had appeared to him in a dream and touched his tongue with a lancet used for letting blood, saying, &#x2018;Behold, I have put my word into your mouth! Go forth to your preaching.&#x2019; From that day, even though he wished, he could not keep silent concerning God&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LOOMIS1946" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Loomis 1946</a>, 410).</p>

<p>&#x201C;Like many traditional accounts, Caedmon&#x2019;s naming represents the sanctioning of the poet or poetic figure by specially empowered authorities. In the story of Finn MacCoul, for example, the young hero is transformed into a poet through the eating of the cooked salmon and the sucking of his burned thumb. Allusively combining references to sacred food and spittle, this moment in the &#x2018;Boyhood Exploits of Finn&#x2019; announces that &#x2018;whenever he put his thumb into his mouth, and sang through <span class="foreign" lang="SGA">teinn laida</span> [illumination of song?], then whatever he had been ignorant of would be revealed to him....&#x2019; The new poet is then renamed: &#x2018;Finn is thy name, my lad&#x2019;. The narrator continues, &#x2018;It is then Finn made this lay to prove his poetry....&#x2019; Much like the Irish poet&#x2019;s performance of his lay&#x2014;a pastoral of Creation&#x2014;C&#x00E6;dmon, newly named, sings his own hymn of Creation to &#x2018;prove his poetry&#x2019; to himself and his angel&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LERER1991" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lerer 1991</a>, 43-44).</p>

<p>&#x201C;In the old times, there was a half-fool living in Dunmore, in the county of Galway, and although he was excessively fond of music, he was unable to learn more than one tune, and that was the &#x2018;Black Rogue&#x2019;. ...One night the piper was coming home from a house where there had been a dance, and he was half drunk. When he came to a little bridge that was up by his mother&#x2019;s house, he squeezed the pipes on, and began playing the &#x2018;Black Rogue&#x2019;.... The P&#x00FA;ca came behind him, and flung him up on his own back. There were long horns on the P&#x00FA;ca, and the piper got a good grip of them...</p>

<p>&#x201C;Then the P&#x00FA;ca said to him, &#x2018;Play up for me the &#x201C;Shan Van Vocht&#x201D;...&#x2019;</p>

<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know it&#x2019;, said the piper.</p>

<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Never mind whether you do or you don&#x2019;t&#x2019;, said the P&#x00FA;ca. &#x2018;Play up, and I&#x2019;ll make you know&#x2019;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The piper put wind in his bag, and he played such music as made himself wonder... and from that day till the day of his death, there was never a piper in the county Galway was as good as he was&#x201D; (Douglas Hyde, cited in <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#VINCENT1946" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Vincent 1946</a>, 61).</p>

<p>&#x201C;[T]he abbot Fursey, a holy man from Ireland, had been found worthy to see heavenly visions. In his infirmity, one day towards evening, while he was occupied in psalmody and prayer, suddenly he fell into a trance and was carried home as one dead. In his trance his soul was borne aloft by angels singing the half-verse, <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Ibunt sancti de virtute in virtutem</span> (Ps. lxxxiv. 7). Now at the end of the flight, he heard another song, as it were unknown to him, sung by thousands of angels. Of this song he could grasp but a few words&#x2014;<span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Exierunt autem obviam Christo</span>. For almost immediately, one of the heavenly host commanded the leading angelic guide to return the soul to the body. Returning, the angels sang the concluding half-verse, <span class="mentioned" lang="LAT">Videbitur deus deorum in Sion</span> (Ps. lxxxiv. 7). In his delight at the sweetness of this song, Fursey could not understand how his soul re-entered his body&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SHEPHERD1954" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Shepherd 1954</a>, 113).</p>

<p>&#x201C;After a night of prayer, towards morning, Godric took a brief respite and looking above the altar saw two virgins. After contemplating them awhile, he completed the additions to the office in such a spirit of joy that his mind seemed almost freed from its earthly shell. At length the figures advanced towards him and the one revealed herself as the Blessed Virgin, and assured him of her patronage. She taught him a new song as if he were a boy at school. She sang it first and he sang it after her. The Virgin instructed him that whensoever he was troubled or tempted he should remember to soothe himself with this song&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#SHEPHERD1954" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Shepherd 1954</a>, 115).</p>

<p>The Turkish minstrel Sabit M&#x00FC;dam&#x00EE; Ataman acquired the desire to become an <span class="foreign" lang="FAS">a&#x015F;ik</span> (singer) in a recurring dream:</p>

<p>&#x201C;There was a chaotic upheaval. An enormous scale was erected in a meeting place where thousands of people had gathered.... All the people from the time of Adam to the present day had assembled. In the background there were shades twelve stories tall. That is, they were people, but they were so tall that a bird couldn&#x2019;t fly that high... To the right of the scale stood a man as tall as a minaret. He had on black clothes and a black hat. To the left side of the scales there stood a short man with a pock-marked face and a yellow complexion. In his hand he held a yellow book. The one with the yellow book in his hand would say a word about each of the people coming to the scale and the other, the impressive one, would say a verse about them.... The big one said to me, &#x2018;Have you learned it, my son?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;, I answered, &#x2018;I have learned it&#x2019;. &#x2018;Read it out and let me see&#x2019;. And I recited it. He touched me on the shoulder with his left hand. &#x2018;Now you stand over there, my child. Let someone else approach&#x2019;. Just then a short, old minstrel, some seventy to seventy-five years of age with a conical hat on his head, appeared. This minstrel had a <span class="foreign" lang="FAS">saz</span> in his hands....</p>

<p>&#x201C;They showed me a yellow book, saying, &#x2018;Read the writing on this book, my child&#x2019;. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know how to read&#x2019;, I said.... &#x2018;Look at it, my child&#x2019;, he said. It was writing in an old script, about two fingers high. What was written on the book was: H&#x00E2;z&#x00E2; Divan&#x00EE; A&#x015F;ik M&#x00FC;dam&#x00EE;.

<p>&#x201C;I picked up the <span class="foreign" lang="FAS">c&#x00FC;z</span>. But now, I looked at the page and it seemed like the letters were talking to me.... I read through one piece. I looked at another one and it was like the piece had been my intimate friend for fifty years.... Later, when I was fourteen years old and I was working as a shepherd, that dream repeated itself... After that I made a <span class="foreign" lang="FAS">saz</span> by stretching horse hair across a board&#x201D; (Natalie Kononenko Moyle, as cited in <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LORD1993" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lord 1993</a>, 123-125).</p>

<p>&#x201C;Mr Mooney reprints songs from the trance-visions of many singers, relating their trance-experiences. Some tell of messengers from the spirit world, and in some... the vision is of the Messiah and the song inspired by him&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#POUND1929" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Pound 1929</a>, 238).</p>

<p>&#x201C;Roger of Hoveden tells how at the funeral of St. Hugh of Lincoln a thief tried to ply his trade; he was rooted to the spot, &#x2018;impelled to compose rather inferior Latin verses whether he would or no&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#WARD1976" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Ward 1976</a>, 74).</p>

<p>&#x201C;[T]he Ngarigo tribe [of South East Australia] believed that they could see ghosts in dreams, and the Yuin Gommeras that they could get songs in dreams. One tribesman said that his uncle came to him during sleep and taught him songs (charms) against sickness and other evils&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#POUND1929" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Pound 1929</a>, 238).</p>

<p>&#x201C;Valmiki, a celebrated Brahmin ascetic, received poetic inspiration as a divine gift and was instructed by the god Brahma to write the <span class="titlem">Ramayana</span>, a verse history of an Indian hero regarded as one of the greatest of the Sanskrit epics&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LESTER1974" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lester 1974</a>, 226).</p>

<p>The Fijian poet Velema &#x201C;alone has inherited the right to practice occult arts in his land-group and bears the sacred tokens. He has the war-club and the axe of his maternal grandfather and uncle and their dancing spear wrapped carefully in barkcloth and secured from vulgar observation in the upper region of his house.... It is the ancient war club and the axe that give him the power to compose epic songs, &#x2018;true songs&#x2019;.... In trance or in sleep the songs come to him, taught him by his supernatural mentors. He takes no personal credit for his composition, does not even distinguish between those which he has composed himself and those old ones which his mother&#x2019;s brother must surely have taught him. All contribute to the glory of his ancestors. Ancestors chant the songs as they teach so that the rhythms implicit in the language are qualified by a musical style which can freely reduplicate syllables to change the stress in words&#x201D; (Buell H. Quain, quoted by <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LORD1993" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lord 1993</a>, 125-126).</p>

<p>&#x201C;In the Old Norse <span class="titlem">Volsa Thattr</span>, an episode in the saga of St. Olaf, there is a peculiar ritual that has structural elements in common with the <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">convivium</span> that Bede describes. In this episode it is not a harp but an ossified horse&#x2019;s penis (<span class="foreign" lang="NON">vingull</span>) wrapped in cloths that is passed around, and each person in turn is expected to recite an appropriate verse&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OSBORN1989" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Osborn 1989</a>, 16).</p>

<p>&#x201C;Walter, a lay-brother at Clairvaux, was visited in his sleep by a saint who taught him the mass of the Holy Spirit; when he woke up, he remembered it, but had the ability neither to learn more nor to use what he had learnt&#x201D; (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#WARD1976" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Ward 1976</a>, 74).</p>
