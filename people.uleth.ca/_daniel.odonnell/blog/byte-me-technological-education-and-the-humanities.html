<p>Note: Published in "_Heroic Age_ 12":http://www.heroicage.org/issues/12/em.php</p>
<p>I recently had a discussion with the head of a humanities 
organisation who wanted to move a website. The website was 
written using Coldfusion, a proprietary suite of server-based 
software that is used by developers for writing and publishing 
interactive web sites (Adobe nd). After some discussion of the 
pros and cons of moving the site, we turned to the question of 
the software.<p> 
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Head of Humanities Organisation:</strong> We'd also 
like to change the software.<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> I'm not sure that is wise unless you really 
have to: it will mean hiring somebody to port everything and you 
are likely to introduce new problems.<br/>
<strong>Head of Humanities Organisation:</strong> But I don't 
have Coldfusion on my computer.<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> Coldfusion is software that runs on a 
server. You don't need it on your computer. You just need it on 
the server. Your techies handle that.<br/>
<strong>Head of Humanities Organisation:</strong> Yes, but I use 
a Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be exaggerating here&#x2014;I can't remember if the person 
really said they used a Mac. But the underlying confusion we 
faced in the conversation was very real: the person I was talking to did 
not seem at all to understand the distinction between a personal 
computer and a network server&#x2014; basic technology by which web 
pages are 
published and read.</p>
<p>This is not an isolated problem. In the last few years, I have been 
involved with a humanities organisation that distributes e-mail by 
cc:-list to its thirty-odd participants because some members believe 
their email system can't access listervers. I have had discussions with 
a scholar working on a very time-consuming web-based research project 
who was intent on inventing a custom method for indicating accents 
because they thought Unicode was too esoteric. I have helped another 
scholar who wrote an entire edition in a proprietary word-processor 
format and needed to recover the significance of the various coloured 
fonts and type faces he had used. And I have attended presentations by 
more than one project that intended to do all their development and 
archiving in layout-oriented HTML.</p> 
<p>These examples all involve basic technological misunderstandings by 
people actively interested in pursuing digital projects of one kind or 
another. When you move outside this relatively small subgroup of 
humanities scholars, the level of technological awareness gets 
correspondingly lower. We all have colleagues who do not understand the 
difference between a blog and a mailing list, who don't know how 
web-pages are composed or published, who can't insert foreign characters 
into a word-processor document, and who are unable to backup or take 
other basic precautions concerning the security of their data.</p>
<p>Until very recently, this technological illiteracy has been 
excusable: humanities researchers and students, quite properly, 
concerned themselves primarily with their disciplinary work. The early 
Humanities Computing experts were working on topics, such as statistical 
analysis, the production of concordances, and building the back-ends for 
dictionaries, that were of no real interest to those who intended simply 
to access the final results of this work. Even after the personal 
computer replaced the typewriter, there was no real need for humanities 
scholars to understand technical details beyond such basics as turning a 
computer on and off and starting up their word-processor. The principal 
format for exchange and storage of scholarly information remained paper 
and the few areas where paper was superseded&#x2014;such as in the use 
of email 
to replace the memo&#x2014;the technology involved was so widely used, 
so 
robust, and above all so useful and so well supported that there was no 
need to learn anything about it: if your email and word-processor 
weren't set up at the store when you bought a computer, you could expect 
this work to be done for you by the technicians at your place of 
employment or over the phone by the Help Desk at your Internet Service 
Provider: nothing about humanities scholars' use of the technology 
required special treatment or distinguished them from the University 
President, a lawyer in a one-person law office... or their 
grandparents.</p>
<p>In the last half-decade, this situation has changed dramatically. The 
principal exchange format for humanities research is no longer paper but 
the digital byte&#x2014;albeit admittedly as represented in PDF and 
word-processor formats (which are intended ultimately for printing or 
uses similar to that for which we print documents). State agencies are 
beginning to require open digital access to publicly-funded research. At 
humanities conferences, an increasing number of sessions focus on 
digital project reports and the application. And as Peter Robinson has 
recently argued, it is rare to discover a new major humanities project 
that does not include a significant digital component as part of its 
plans (Robinson 2005). Indeed some of the most interesting and exciting 
work in many fields is taking advantage of technology such as GPS, 
digital imaging, gaming, social networking, and multimedia digital 
libraries that was unheard of or still very experimental less than a 
decade ago.</p>
<p>That humanists are heavily engaged with technology should come, of 
course, as no real surprise. Humanities computing as a discipline can 
trace its origins back to the relatively early days of the computer, and 
a surprising number of the developments that led to the revolution in 
digital communication over the last decade were led by people with 
backgrounds in humanities research. The XML specification (XML is the 
computer language that underlies all sophisticated web-based 
applications, from your bank statement to Facebook) was edited under the 
supervision of C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen, who has a PhD in Comparative 
Literature from Stanford and was a lead editor of the Text Encoding 
Initiative (TEI) <i>Guidelines</i>, the long-standing standard for 
textual markup in the humanities, before he moved to the W3C 
(Sperberg-McQueen 2007). Michael Everson, the current registrar and a 
co-author of the Unicode standard for the representation of characters 
for use with computers, has an M.A. from UCLA in Indo-European 
linguistics and was a Fulbright Scholar in Irish at the University of 
Dublin (Evertype 2003-2006). David Megginson, who has also led 
committees at the W3C and was the principal developer of SAX, a very 
widely used processor for XML, has a PhD in Old English from the 
University of Toronto and was employed at the Dictionary of Old English 
and the University of Ottawa before moving to the private sector 
(Wikipedia Contributors 2008).</p>
<p>Just as importantly, the second generation of interactive web 
technology (the so-called "Web 2.0") is causing the general public to 
engage with exactly the type of questions we research. The Wikipedia has 
turned the writing of dusty old encyclopedias into a hobby much like 
ham-radio. The social networking site Second Life has seen the 
construction of virtual representations of museums, and libraries. 
Placing images of a manuscript library or museum's holding on the web is 
a sure way of increasing in-person traffic at the institution. The 
newest field for the study of such phenomenon, Information Studies, is 
also one of the oldest: almost without exception, departments of 
Information Studies are housed in and are extensions of traditional 
Library science programmes.</p>
<p>The result of this technological revolution is that very few active 
humanists can now truthfully say that they have absolutely no reason to 
understand the technology underlying their work. Whether we are board 
members of an academic society, working on a research project that is 
considering the pros and cons of on-line publication, instructors who 
need to publish lecture notes to the web, researchers who are searching 
JSTOR for secondary literature in our discipline, or the head of a 
humanities organisation that wants to move its web-site, we are all 
increasingly involved in circumstances that require us to make basic 
technological decisions. Is this software better than that? What are the 
long-term archival implications for storing digital information in 
format <i>x</i> vs. format <i>y</i>? Will users be able to make 
appropriate use of our digitally-published data? How do we ensure the 
quality of crowd-sourced contributions? Are we sure that the technology 
we are using will not become obsolete in an unacceptably short period of 
time? Will on-line publication destroy our journal's subscriber 
base?</p>
<p>The problem is that these are not always questions that we can "leave 
to the techies." It is true that many universities have excellent 
technical support and that there are many high-quality private 
contractors available who can help with basic technological 
implementation. And while the computer skills of our students is often 
over-rated, it is possible to train them to carry out many day-to-day 
technological tasks. But such assistance is only as good as the scholar 
who requests it. If the scholar who hires a student or asks for advice 
from their university's technical services does not know in broad terms 
what they want or what the minimum technological standards of their 
discipline are, they are likely to receive advice and help that is at 
best substandard and perhaps even counter-productive. Humanities 
researchers work on a time-scale and with archival standards far beyond 
those of the average client needing assistance with the average web-site 
or multimedia presentation. We all know of important print research in 
our disciplines that is still cited decades after the date of original 
publication. Not a few scholarly debates in the historical sciences have 
hinged on questions of whether a presentation of material adequately 
represents the "original" medium, function, or intention. Unless he or 
she has special training, a technician asked by a scholar to "build a 
website" for an editorial project may very well not understand the 
extent to which such questions require the use of different approaches 
to the composition, storage, and publication of data than those required 
to design and publish the athletic department's fall football 
schedule.</p>
<p>Even if your technical assistant is able to come up with a 
responsible solution for your request without direction from somebody 
who knows the current standards for Digital Humanities research in your 
discipline, the problem remains that such advice almost certainly would 
be reactive: the technician would be responding to your (perhaps naive) 
request for assistance, not thinking of new disciplinary questions that 
you might be able to ask if you knew more about the existing options. 
Might you be able to ask different questions by employing new or novel 
technology like GPS, serious gaming, or social networking? Can 
technology help you (or your users) see your results in a different way? 
Are there ways that your project could be integrated with other projects 
looking at similar types of material or using different technologies. 
Would your work benefit from distribution in some of the new publication 
styles like blogs or wikis? These are questions that require a strong 
grounding in the original humanistic discipline <i>and</i> a 
more-than-passing knowledge of current technology and digital genres. 
Many of us have students who know more than than we do about on-line 
search engines; while we might hire such students to assist us in the 
compilation of our bibliographies, we would not let them set our 
research agendas or determine the contours of project we hire them to 
work on. Handing technological design of a major humanities research 
project over to a non-specialist university IT department or a student 
whose only claim to expertise is that they are better than you at 
instant messaging is no more responsible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our home humanistic disciplines have had to deal with 
this kind of problem before. Many graduate, and even some undergraduate, 
departments require students to take courses in research methods, 
bibliography, or theory as part of their regular degree programmes. The 
goal of such courses is not necessarily to turn such students into 
librarians, textual scholars, or theorists&#x2014;though I suppose we 
wouldn't 
complain if some of them discovered a previously unknown interest. 
Rather, it is to ensure that students have a background in such 
fundamental areas sufficient to allow them to conduct their own research 
without making basic mistakes or suffering unnecessary delays while they 
discover by trial-and-error things that might far more efficiently be 
taught to them upfront in the lecture hall. </p>
<p>In the case of technology, I believe we have now reached the stage 
where we need to be giving our students a similar grounding. We do not 
need to produce IT specialists&#x2014;though it is true that a 
well-trained 
and 
knowledgeable Digital Humanities graduate has a combination of 
technological skills and experience with real-world problems and 
concepts that are very easily transferable to the private sector. But we 
do need to produce graduates who understand the technological world in 
which we now live&#x2014;and, more importantly, how this technology can 
help 
them do better work in their home discipline.</p>
<p>The precise details of such an understanding will vary from 
discipline to discipline. Working as an Anglo-Saxonist and a textual 
critic in an English department, I will no doubt consider different 
skills and knowledge to be essential than I would if I were a church 
historian or theologian. But in its basic outlines such a orientation to 
the Digital Humanities probably need not vary too much from humanities 
department to humanities department. We simply should no longer be 
graduating students who do not know the basic history and nature of web 
technologies, what a database is and how it is designed and used, the 
importance of keeping content and processing distinct from each other, 
and the archival and maintenance issues involved in the development of 
robust digital standards like Unicode and the TEI <i>Guidelines</i>. 
Such students should be able to discuss the practical differences (and 
similarities) of print vs. web publication; they should be able to 
assess intelligently from a variety of different angles the pros and 
cons of different approaches to basic problems involving the 
digitisation of text, two and three-dimensional imaging, animation, and 
archival storage and cataloguing; and they should be acquainted with 
basic digital pedagogical tools (course management and testing software; 
essay management and plagiarism detection software) and the new digital 
genres and rhetorics (wikis, blogs, social networking sites, comment 
boards) that they are likely to be asked to consider in their future 
research and teaching. </p>
<p>Not all humanists need to become Digital Humanists. Indeed, in 
attending conferences in the last few years and observing the 
increasingly diverging interests and research questions pursued by those 
who identify themselves as "Digital Humanists" and those who define 
themselves primarily as traditional domain specialists, I am beginning 
to wonder if we are not seeing the beginnings of a split between 
"experimentalists" and "theorists" similar to that which exists today in 
some of the natural sciences. But just as theoretical and experimental 
scientists need to maintain some awareness of what each branch of their 
common larger discipline is doing if the field as a whole is to 
progress, so too must there remain an interaction between the 
traditional humanistic and digital humanistic domains if our larger 
fields are also going to continue to make the best use of the new tools 
and technologies available to us. As humanists, we are, unavoidably, 
making increasing use of digital media in our research and 
dissemination. If this work is to take the best advantage of these new 
tools and rhetorics&#x2014;and not inadvertently harm our work by 
naively 
adopting techniques that are already known to represent poor practice, 
we need to start treating a basic knowledge of relevant digital 
technology and rhetorics as a core research skill in much the same way 
we currently treat bibliography and research methods.</p>
