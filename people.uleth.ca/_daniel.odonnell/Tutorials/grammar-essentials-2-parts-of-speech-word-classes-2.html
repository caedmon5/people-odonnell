	<p>Words are different from each other in meaning—<em>car</em> and <em>unwelcome</em> mean different things, after all. </p>

	<p>But they can also differ from each other in more than meaning: they can also differ in the way they are used in sentences. </p>

	<p>Thus sentences can be about a word like <em>car</em> more easily than they can be about a word like <em>unwelcome</em>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li>&#x002a;<strong>Unwelcomes</strong> are on the road<sup id="fnrev163192642952e42c35b2d72" class="footnote"><a href="#fn163192642952e42c35b2d72">1</a></sup></li>
	</ul>

	<p>With a word like <em>car</em>, we also can talk about one or more examples: <em>a car is here</em>, <em>cars are here</em>. We can describe its qualities using other words like <em>red</em>, <em>fast</em>, or <em>good</em>: &#8220;<em>red</em> cars are here&#8221;,  &#8220;<em>fast</em> cars are here&#8221;, &#8220;<em>good</em> cars are here&#8221;. And a word like <em>car</em> can be said to possess things: <em>the car&#8217;s tires</em>, <em>cars&#8217; steering wheels</em></p>

	<p>None of this is true of a word like <em>unwelcome</em>. But <em>unwelcome</em> can be used in ways a word like <em>car</em> cannot: it can be used to describe qualities of other words (<em>The unwelcome news</em>, <em>This news was unwelcome</em>, vs. <em>*The car news</em> or [<em>*This news was car</em>); it can be made more intense using words like <em>very</em> or <em>really</em> (<em>it was very unwelcome</em>, vs. <em>*It was very car</em>).</p>

	<p>The real test, of course, is that the two words can&#8217;t be switched in a sentence. We couldn&#8217;t replace <em>car</em> with <em>unwelcome</em> in the example above, and it is impossible<sup id="fnrev85751935852e42c35b484c" class="footnote"><a href="#fn85751935852e42c35b484c">2</a></sup> to replace <em>unwelcome</em> with <em>car</em> in this following sentence:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>That was really <strong>unwelcome</strong> news.</li>
		<li><strong>That was really *car</strong> news.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It <em>is</em> possible, on the other hand, to replace <em>car</em> and <em>unwelcome</em> with other words, even if the meaning of the new words is nothing like that of the words they replace:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Bartenders</strong> are on the road.</li>
		<li>That was really <strong>good</strong> news.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>So why can <em>car</em> be replaced by <em>bartender</em> and not <em>unwelcome</em> or <em>good</em>? And why can <em>unwelcome</em> be replaced by <em>good</em> but not <em>bartender</em> or <em>car</em>?</p>

	<p>The answer is that <em>car</em> and <em>bartender</em>, on the one hand, and <em>unwelcome</em> and <em>good</em>, on the other, are different <em>types</em> of words. As we will learn, <em>car</em> and <em>bartender</em> show in normal use most of the properties we associate with <em>nouns</em> while   <em>unwelcome</em> and <em>good</em> show in normal use most of the properties we associate with <em>adjectives</em>. The fact that you can replace <em>car</em> with <em>bartender</em> and <em>unwelcome</em> with <em>good</em> shows that you can replace nouns with nouns and adjectives with adjectives more easily than you can replace words of one type with words of a different type.</p>

	<p>This tutorial explores this property in greater depth. Traditionally, word classes have been distinguished on semantic grounds (e.g. &#8220;Nouns are the names of person places or things&#8221;; &#8220;verbs are action words&#8221;). As this tutorial will demosntrate, these traditional definitions, while not usually wrong, are often quite ambiguous. This is because the class a word belongs to is largely a question of syntax rather than meaning, especially given the ease with which English can move words from one class to another without any change in morphological form. </p>

	<p>By the end of this tutorial you should be able to distinguish among word classes confidently.</p>

	<h2>Words and Phrases</h2>

	<p>If we continue testing like this, we will also soon discover not only that some words are more easily exchanged with one other than with others, but also that individual words can be used to replace entire groups of closely connected words (and vice versa). For example, the word <em>bartenders</em> can replace more than <em>cars</em> in the following sentences; it also can replace entire groups of closely connected words involving <em>cars</em>—groups like  <em>the cars</em>, <em>the blue cars</em>, and even <em>the blue cars that sold so well last year</em>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>The cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>The blue cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>The blue cars that sold so well last year</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>Bartenders</strong> are on the road.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>On the other hand, we still can&#8217;t use <em>unwelcome</em> to replace <em>cars</em>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cars</strong> are on the road.</li>
		<li>&#x002a;<strong>Unwelcomes</strong> are on the road.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If we experiment, we will see that we can&#8217;t replace just any group of words using <em>bartender</em>: the words need to be somehow more closely related to each other than any other part of the sentence and involve a word like <em>car</em>. In the following sentence, for example, we can use <em>bartenders</em> to replace <em>the blue cars</em>, but not <em>blue cars are on</em>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>The blue cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>Bartenders</strong> are on the road</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>The blue cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li>&#x002a;<strong>The bartenders</strong> road<sup id="fnrev111763578852e42c35c1c3c" class="footnote"><a href="#fn111763578852e42c35c1c3c">3</a></sup>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Clearly there is something about the words <em>the blue cars</em> that makes us think of them as being more closely connected to each other than to anything else in the sentence. And just as the fact that we  can replace <em>car</em> with <em>bartender</em> but not <em>unwelcome</em> in the sentences above suggests that there must be something similar about <em>car</em> and <em>bartender</em>, so to the fact that we can use <em>bartenders</em> to replace <em>cars</em> and groups of closely related words like <em>the cars</em> or <em>the blue cars</em> suggests that there must be something similar about the single word <em>cars</em> and these particular combinations of words.</p>

	<p>As we shall discover, combinations of closely connected words that behave in much the same way as individual words are known as <em>Phrases</em>. As we define the different types of words below, we will see that each type of word has an associated type of phrase to which many of the same rules apply. This principle will become very important when we come to talk about how sentences are made.</p>

	<h2>Open and Closed Word Classes</h2>

	<p>Another difference that separates words is the question of how easy or difficult it is to make up new examples. If I want to replace <em>car</em> or <em>cars</em> in the above sentences with a new word that I will make up myself—say <em>slipshlup</em>—I can do so very easily:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>Slipshlups</strong> are on the road</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>The cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>The slipshlups</strong> are on the road</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>The blue cars</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>The blue slipshlups</strong> are on the road</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>The blue cars that sold so well last year</strong> are on the road</li>
		<li><strong>The blue slipshlups that sold so well last year</strong> are on the road</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Bartenders</strong> are on the road.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Likewise, it is not hard to make up a word like <em>unwelcome</em>. How about <em>griopy</em>?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>That was really <strong>unwelcome</strong> news.</li>
		<li>That was really <strong>griopy</strong> news.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>But if it easy to make up new words parallel to <em>cars</em> and <em>unwelcome</em>, it is much harder—impossible, in fact—to make up replacements for words like <em>the</em>, <em>and</em>, <em>but</em> or <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, and <em>it</em>. For example, try repeating the following sentence with the following made-up words: <em>hin</em> for <em>the</em>, <em>roop</em> for <em>and</em>, and <em>fries</em> for <em>she</em>. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>The cars and the boats were on the road, but they were not for sale, she said.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Doesn&#8217;t make much sense, does it?</p>

	<h2>The Parts of Speech/Word Classes</h2>

	<p>If we compare English words in the way discussed above<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn111763578852e42c35c1c3c">3</a></sup>, we will discover that it is possible to divide words and closely associated groups of words like them into eight main types, known as the <em>parts of speech</em> or <em>word classes</em> (a minor ninth category contains interjections. like &#8220;oh dear!&#8221; and &#8220;damn!&#8221; and is not discussed further in this tutorial). We will also discover that these Word Classes themselves fall into two larger groups based on whether or not we can easily add new examples: the  <em>Open Class</em> contains word classes that we easily can add to—nouns, adjectives, most types of verbs, and adverbs; the <em>Closed or Structure Class</em> contains words, like prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, most determiners, and some adverbs, to which we can not add easily:</p>

	<h2>Open Classes</h2>

	<h3>Nouns and Noun Phrases</h3>

	<p>Nouns are naming words. Traditionally they are defined as the names of persons, places, and things, but their actual range is much broader: they can name ideas, moods, and feelings (e.g. <em>neoconservatism</em>, <em>anger</em>, and <em>affection</em>); actions (<em>the hiking</em>), or pretty much anything else known or unknown (e.g. <em>Slipshlup</em>, above).</p>

	<p>Fortunately, given how hard it can be to define them by what they describe, nouns and noun phrases can be defined relatively easily by their form and the contexts in which they appear. In particular they show one or more of the following unique features:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Nouns are the only words that use &#8220;apostrophe s&#8221; (i.e. <em>&#8216;s</em> or <em>s&#8217;</em>) to show possession. In the following sentence, we know that <em>Dave</em>, <em>Neoconservatism</em>, and <em>anger</em> are all nouns because they indicate possession by adding <em>-&#8216;s</em>: <em>Dave&#8217;s book</em>, <em>Neoconservatism&#8217;s origins</em>, <em>anger&#8217;s solution</em>.</li>
		<li>Nouns are the only words that can be modified by adjectives: <em>blue cars</em>, <em>unwelcome news</em>, <em>clever Sally</em>.</li>
		<li>Nouns are the only words that can be made plural by adding <em>-s</em>: <em><span class="caps">DVD</span></em> : <em><span class="caps">DVD</span>s</em>, <em>cup</em> : <em>cups</em>, <em>theology</em> : <em>theologies</em>.</li>
		<li>Nouns are the only words that can be pointed to by <em>determiners</em>. Determiners, as we will see below, are words such as <em>the</em> and <em>a</em>, <em>that</em> and <em>this</em>, and possessives such as <em>his</em> or <em>Brigette&#8217;s</em> that point out specific instances of a noun, e.g. <em>the boat</em>, <em>a slipshlup</em>, <em>that hiking</em>, <em>Brigette&#8217;s <span class="caps">DVD</span></em>, <em>his anger</em>.</li>
		<li>Nouns and Noun Phrases are the only words that can be replaced by a pronoun: <em>The deer grazed quietly at the side of the road</em> : <em>It grazed quietly at the side of the road</em></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Other tests are not entirely exclusive, for example:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Nouns and pronouns are the only words that can function as the subject of a sentence: <em>The car ran through the red light</em> : <em>It ran through the red light</em>.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It is important to realise in applying these tests that not all words will fit all categories. Some nouns do not form their plural with <em>-s</em>, for example: e.g. <em>child</em> : <em>children</em>; <em>sheep</em> : <em>sheep</em>. What is important is that one or more of these tests be true.</p>

	<h3>Verbs</h3>

	<p>Verbs are traditionally defined as &#8220;action words.&#8221; Even more than with nouns, however, this definition fails to cover more than a narrow range of possible examples or rule out obvious counter-examples. While some verbs do express action (e.g. <em>she</em> hit <em>the wall with a hammer</em>), others do not (e.g. <em>I</em> am <em>the king</em>, <em>he</em> knows <em>his baseball</em>). Moreover, actions can also be named by nouns: <em>This</em> hiking <em>is very hard</em>; <em>I don&#8217;t like all this</em> hitting).</p>

	<p>Like nouns, verbs can be defined more accurately on grammatical criteria. Particularly useful ones include:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Verbs are the only words that show <em>tense</em> (i.e. past or present): <em>he loves cheesecake</em> : <em>he loved cheesecake</em>; <em>I drive fast</em> : <em>I drove fast</em>.</li>
		<li>Verbs are the only words that indicate third person singular, present by adding <em>-s</em> at the end: <em>I drive</em>, <em>he drives</em></li>
		<li>Verbs are the only words that can be made into participles (i.e. adjective forms) using the endings <em>-ed</em>, <em>-en</em>, or <em>-ing</em>: <em>I love</em> : <em>loving</em> : <em>loved</em>; <em>They drive</em> : <em>driving</em> : <em>driven</em></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Verb Phrases include the verb plus all objects and modifiers. These can get quite large. One test for some verb phrases is replacement by <em>do</em> in questions designed to be answered with &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Bobbi loves getting presents in the morning, does she?</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In asking the question &#8220;does she&#8221;, the speaker is summing up the whole idea &#8220;loves getting presents in the morning&#8221; by a single form of <em>do</em>. This shows that &#8220;loves getting presents in the morning&#8221;  is a Verb Phrase.</p>

	<h3>Adjectives</h3>

	<p>Adjectives describe qualities to nouns. One easy test, though it is also true of adverbs, is placing <em>very</em> or <em>really</em> in front:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Adjectives and adverbs are the only words that can be made more intense by adding <em>very</em> or <em>really</em> in front: <em>the really fast car was very red</em></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Here are some tests that are only true of adjectives:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Adjectives are the only words that can have endings to indicate that something is <em>more</em> or <em>most</em> in relation to some quality: <em>the fast car was red</em> : <em>the faster car was green</em> : <em>the fastest car was blue</em>. Of course some adjectives don&#8217;t use <em>-er</em> and/or <em>-est</em>: <em>more unwelcome</em> not <em>*unwelcomer</em>; <em>best</em> nor <em>goodest</em>.</li>
		<li>Adjectives and adjective phrases are the only words that can appear between determiners (like <em>the</em>, <em>a</em>, or possessives) and nouns: <em>the fast car</em>, <em>Dave&#8217;s really nice cake</em>, <em>a very sad clown</em>.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Adverbs</h3>

	<p>Adverbs are traditionally described as words that modify verbs. In fact there are three different kinds of adverbs, each of which can be distinguished by context.</p>

	<h4>Intensifying adverbs</h4>

	<p>Intensifying adverbs are words like <em>very</em> that are used to qualify adjectives and other adverbs. They do not qualify verbs directly: <em>his very angry cousin</em> vs. <em>*he very jumps</em>. Some intensifying adverbs can be used with slightly different meaning to modify verbs: <em>he skates really fast</em>, <em>he really skates</em>.</p>

	<h4>Sentence adverbs</h4>

	<p>Sentence adverbs qualify sentences and clauses: <em>Unfortunately</em>, the boat sank; I don&#8217;t want to, <em>however</em>; <em>then</em> he knew for sure.</p>

	<h4>Verbal adverbs</h4>

	<p>Verbal adverbs qualify verbs: He jumped <em>quickly</em>, he wrote <em>well</em>. Like adjectives, they can be intensified by words like <em>very</em>: she drove very <em>quickly</em>, Beatrice cooks really <em>well</em>.</p>

	<h2>Closed class words</h2>

	<h3>Determiners</h3>

	<p>Determiners are words that are used to point out specific instances of a noun. They include the <em>articles</em> (<em>a</em>, <em>the</em>), <em>demonstratives</em> (<em>this/these</em>, <em>that/those</em>), and all possessive nouns and pronouns (this means that a form like <em>Dave&#8217;s</em> in <em>Dave&#8217;s book</em> is both a noun and a determiner).</p>

	<p>The test for determiners is very straightforward:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Determiners precede nouns and any qualifying adjectives. The first word in each of the following phrases is a determiner:  <em>the</em> book, <em>the</em> large book, <em>Dave&#8217;s</em> really ugly book, <em>my</em> car, <em>my sister&#8217;s</em> car (in this last example, both <em>my</em> and <em>my sister&#8217;s</em> are determiners: <em>my</em> points to <em>sister</em> and <em>my sister&#8217;s</em> points to <em>car</em>).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Prepositions</h3>

	<p>Prepositions serve to connect nouns or noun phrases (e.g. <em>cars</em> or <em>the car</em>) to a clause or sentence. Examples include <em>up a mountain</em>, <em>down the street</em>, with <em>friends</em>, <em>beside him</em>, <em>without a wooden paddle</em>.</p>

	<p>In English, there are a relatively small number of simple prepositions, such as <em>up</em>, <em>down</em>, <em>with</em>. There are also a number of phrasal or compound prepositions, especially in spoken English: <em>outside of the English</em>, <em>apart from Dave&#8217;s cat</em>, <em>round and round the mountain</em>.</p>

	<p>Many of the prepositions can be memorised. Otherwise, prepositions can be recognised by their syntactic context:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Prepositions are always followed by noun phrases (i.e. nouns with any associated determiners and adjectives, or pronouns) that serve as their objects<sup id="fnrev204626717652e42c35df67b" class="footnote"><a href="#fn204626717652e42c35df67b">5</a></sup>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Pronouns</h3>

	<p>Pronouns are words that can substitute for nouns or noun phrases. Examples include <em>personal pronouns</em> like <em>she/her</em>, <em>I/me/my</em>, <em>they/them/their</em>; demonstratives like <em>this/these</em>, <em>that/those</em>; and other forms, such as <em>each</em>, <em>none</em>, and <em>one</em>:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><em>My</em> sister is here. <em>She</em> wants to talk to <em>you</em>.</li>
		<li>The green carrots are probably rotten. <em>I</em> wouldn&#8217;t eat <em>them</em>.</li>
		<li><em>My</em> books are here. <em>These</em> over here are <em>yours</em>.</li>
		<li>The members of the committee were awstruck. <em>None</em> had expected this.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Because pronouns replace nouns, they can be identified using some of the same tests. In particular,</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Pronouns (with nouns) are the only words that can serve as the subject of a sentence: <em>he ran the country</em>; <em>she scored five goals</em>; <em>it was hit by a train</em>.</li>
		<li>Pronouns (with nouns) are the only words that can serve as the object of a verb or preposition: <em>outside this</em>, <em>with him</em>, <em>she cut it</em>.</li>
		<li>Pronouns (with nouns) are the only words that can take a possessive inflection—though unlike nouns, the possessive is never <em>&#8216;s</em> or <em>s&#8217;</em> and rarely <em>s</em>: <em>my books</em>, <em>your garage</em>, <em>her cannon</em>, <em>his snow shovel</em><sup id="fnrev27607408752e42c35e1d48" class="footnote"><a href="#fn27607408752e42c35e1d48">6</a></sup>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Conjunctions</h3>

	<p>Conjunctions are used to join grammatical units. Unlike prepositions, which join nouns or noun phrases to sentences, conjunctions always join elements of a similar kind: nouns and noun phrases to other nouns and noun phrases, verbs to verbs, adjectives to adjectives: it is raining cats <em>and</em> dogs (noun to noun); I neither pushed <em>nor</em> pulled (verb to verb); I went out <em>because</em> he didn&#8217;t come in (clause to clause).</p>

	<h2>Exercises </h2>

	<p>(<a href="grammar-essentials-2-parts-of-speech-word-classes-exercise-answers-2.html">Click here for Answers</a>)</p>

	<p>The following exercises test you on your ability to apply the above material. The real test of your knowledge of grammar is not whether you are able to memorise terms and definitions, but whether you can supply examples and describe real-life sentences.</p>

	<p>1. Place each word in the following sentence in its Word Class using the above tests. Which Word Class(es) is or are missing?:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Over the mountain lived a former mechanic. Suzy forgets his name.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>2. When Hamlet says that bad acting &#8220;out-herods Herod&#8221; (<em>Hamlet</em>, <span class="caps">III</span>.ii), meaning to rage and rant, he is using a proper name for a verb. What tests can we use to show that <em>out-herods</em> is a verb?</p>

	<p>3. Although it is impossible for individuals to create new Closed or Structure Class words, the English language has acquired new pronouns over the course of its history: the entire plural pronoun system <em>they</em>, <em>them</em>, <em>their</em> comes from Old Norse (the original English version was <em>hie</em>, <em>hira</em> and <em>him</em>); <em>she</em> is of unknown origin (the original was <em>heo</em>).</p>

	<p>Can you suggest some reasons why it is possible for languages to add or change such words but not for individuals?</p>

	<h2>Notes</h2>

	<p id="fn163192642952e42c35b2d72" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> An asterisk (i.e. *) in front of a word or group of words means &#8220;This word or group of words is not something people would say&#8221;. An explanation mark (i.e. !) in front of a word or a group of words means &#8220;It is doubtful that this is something people would say&#8221; or &#8220;People might say this, but only in special circumstances&#8221;</p>

	<p id="fn85751935852e42c35b484c" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup> &#8220;Impossible&#8221; may seem too definite at first. In fact it is almost always possible to think of a situation in which a grammatical rule might be shown to be wrong: for example, let&#8217;s say we were talking about a band called &#8220;The Unwelcome&#8220;—then they probably could replace <em>car</em> in our example sentences.</p>

	<p>As a rule, however, you should always be suspicious of counter-examples that require you to create a &#8220;back-story&#8221; to explain the conditions under which an exception might work. The fact that you need a story to explain the context is evidence that the counter-example is very unusual in normal speech.</p>

	<p id="fn111763578852e42c35c1c3c" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup> You <em>could</em> say &#8220;The bartenders&#8217; road&#8221; or &#8220;The bartender&#8217;s road&#8221;, but that would not really count, since <em>cars</em> in the original sentence did not have an &#8220;apostrophe s.&#8221; In the starting sentence, <em>cars</em> was plural, not possessive or plural possessive.</p>

	<p id="fn4" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup> Traditionally, students learned to categorise the parts of speech on the basis of meaning. For example, nouns were said to be &#8220;the name of a person, place, or thing,&#8221; while verbs were described as &#8220;action words.&#8221; While there is some truth to these definitions in many cases, the distinctions break down very easily in others. <em>The fighting</em> is a noun, even though it describes an action; <em>is</em>, on the other hand, is a verb, even though it describes a state.</p>

	<p>Since words are a feature of grammar, the method used here attempts to identify them on the basis of their grammatical properties: the roles they can play in the sentence, the inflections they can take, how they can be converted from one part of speech to another.</p>

	<p id="fn204626717652e42c35df67b" class="footnote"><sup>5</sup> &#8220;Always&#8221;, except in poetry, where they can sometimes follow the words they connect to the sentence.</p>

	<p id="fn27607408752e42c35e1d48" class="footnote"><sup>6</sup> This rule—pronouns never end in apostrophe <em>-s</em>—might be useful in helping you avoid the common stylistic/prescriptive grammar error of using <em>it&#8217;s</em> (actually the abbreviation for <em>it is</em>) in your writing instead of the possessive form, <em>its</em>. In speaking, of course, you can&#8217;t hear any difference.</p>

	<p>USMAN: The tests are inherently comparative: a word is a noun if it fits the tests for noun and a verb if it fits the test for verb. Look at question 2 in the exercises, and compare &#8220;out-herods&#8221; against &#8220;Herod.&#8221; </p>

	<p>I recommend to my students that they memorise one or two simple words and sentences in which they know how each word works against the tests and which part of speech it is (the examples I use above are good simple ones you could use). Then when you are in doubt about what part of speech a new form is, you compare it against the words you&#8217;ve memorised until you find the one it is most like.</p>
