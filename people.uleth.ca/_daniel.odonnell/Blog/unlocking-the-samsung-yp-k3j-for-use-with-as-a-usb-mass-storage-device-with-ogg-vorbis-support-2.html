	<p style="color:black;background-color:yellow;"><strong>Note 1:</strong> Since the middle of September 2008, there have been mixed reports as to the success of this method: some people have reported having trouble, others a flawless experience (see the comments at the end of this page&#8212;and please report your experience so others can get a sense of the likelihood of success). I don&#8217;t know why this is&#8212;it could be that Samsung has changed something on the device in some markets to stop people from reflashing the firmware, for example. Once again: if you try this out, please report your results below so others can gauge how likely they are to have success.</p>

	<p style="color:black;background-color:yellow;"><strong>Note 2:</strong> Although the instructions below indicate that you can only use tcctools with Windows, the author of tcctools indicates that the utility can be compiled with Linux&#8230; meaning you may not even need a windows machine (see comment 21).</p>

	<p style="color:black;background-color:yellow;"><strong>Note 3:</strong> Please remember that as with all such posting on the web, I am simply sharing what worked for me. I gathered this information from other sites and posted it as a mnemonic for myself. Others are free to use it and initially nobody seemed to have anything other than my flawless experience. Recently some people have been reporting trouble. Since Samsung have tried in the past to make the firmware difficult to change, it is always possible that they might try again in the future. <strong>Whenever you try to hack an electronic device you need to be prepared to accept the risk that you might wreck things as well. You should never try to hack something if you are not prepared to accept failure.</strong></p>

	<p><img src="../images/83.jpg" class="right" title="The Samsung YP-K3JAB" alt="The Samsung YP-K3JAB" /> I&#8217;m getting tired of flying on Air Canada and discovering that the on-board sound system is broken. So I went out and bought myself an digital audio (i.e. MP3) player.</p>

	<p>I am a Linux user and as a result have a moderately large number of ripped CDs encoded using the open source <span class="caps">OGG</span> Vorbis standard, rather than the proprietary MP3 format. In looking for an audio player, therefore, I needed one that could play the open source standard alongside MP3s. And be used with a non-Windows operating system.</p>

	<p>After a little research at the <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/PortablePlayers">Vorbis site</a> and at the site for my local electronic retailer, I settled on the Samsung YP-K3JAB (4GB). According the retailer specs, this was supposed to play Vorbis format files. And while the specs suggested it might only be compatible with Windows operating systems, it is actually pretty rare to find a peripheral that really <em>only</em> works with Windows. Somebody has always created a workaround.</p>

	<h3>Compatibility Problems</h3>

	<p>When I got the player home, I was disappointed to make a couple of discoveries:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Despite what the retailer&#8217;s spec sheet indicates, the Canadian version of the player could only handle MP3 and <span class="caps">WMA</span> (Windows Media) file formats.</li>
		<li>Support for <span class="caps">MTP</span> in Linux is pretty poor: while Rhythm box can import from <span class="caps">MTP</span> devices, it can&#8217;t write to them, meaning it was next to impossible to get my music onto the device without going through Windows.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Why the K3 doesn&#8217;t work as advertised</h3>

	<p>After some further research, I discovered both the problem and the solution. It turns out that Samsung ships two or three versions of the firmware that accompanies the K3</p>

	<ol>
		<li>a 1.xxx/3.xxx series firmware that plays only MP3/<span class="caps">WMA</span> formats and uses the <span class="caps">MTP</span> protocol that restricts the device for use with Windows</li>
		<li>a 4xxx series firmware that plays Vorbis as well a MP3/<span class="caps">WMA</span> and allows the device to function as a standard <span class="caps">UMS</span> (Flash Memory) device and work with all operating systems.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The 1.xxx/.3xxx series firmware is shipped with the K3 everywhere except Korea, where the 4.xxx series is used.</p>

	<p>As an added complication, the most recent version of the 3.xxx series firmware (3.09) is designed to stop users from switching to the 4.xxx firmware. And my version of the K3 had the 3.09 firmware.</p>

	<h3>The solution</h3>

	<p style="color:black;background-color:yellow;">Please see the warnings above and the comments at the bottom. As with any hack, there is a chance that you will not succeed and that your machine will become useless. <strong>Do not attempt this if you are not prepared to accept failure!</strong></p>

	<p>I found a solution to the problem at <a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/">anythingbutipod.com</a>. The relevant thread is <a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/forum/showthread.php?t=26947">http://www.anythingbutipod.com/forum/showthread.php?t=26947</a> (see also <a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/forum/showthread.php?t=14516">http://www.anythingbutipod.com/forum/showthread.php?t=14516</a> for earlier discussion).</p>

	<p><img src="../images/84.png" class="left" title="Screenshot showing the YP-K3JAB as mountable USB Disk with OGG files" alt="Screenshot showing the YP-K3JAB as mountable USB Disk with OGG files" /> The instructions were very clear and the patching worked exactly as claimed. The only problem was that I couldn&#8217;t find a copy of the 4.10 firmware and couldn&#8217;t find a manual copy of the 4.0 firmware. Since this required some modification of the instructions, I thought I&#8217;d post the version that worked for me here:</p>

	<h4>Materials</h4>

	<p>To patch your K3 from the 3.xx series to the 4.xx series, you will need the following material. Because the recovery driver tcctool is a windows executable, you will also need to use a windows box initially (see <a href="unlocking-the-samsung-yp-k3j-for-use-with-as-a-usb-mass-storage-device-with-ogg-vorbis-support-2.html#c000629">comment 21</a> below for information on how to get a linux version of tcctool).</p>

	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://download.rockbox.org/utils/tcctool/tcctool-win32.zip">tcctool-win32.zip</a> from <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a></li>
		<li>Copies of the 4.xxx series firmware (at least version 4.03). Links to these seem to come and go. Here&#8217;s what I used:
	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://www.yepp.co.kr/support/support_file_down_sms.jsp?pds_num=1665&amp;seq_num=1">4.03 Firmware</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://org.downloadcenter.samsung.com/downloadfile/ContentsFile.aspx?CDSite=HQ&amp;CttFileID=1487170&amp;CDCttType=FM&amp;ModelType=N&amp;ModelName=YP-K3AB&amp;VPath=FM/200705/20070522141327468_MSC_WA.zip">4.06 Firmware Windows Executable</a></li>
	</ol></li>
	</ol>

	<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: If you know somebody who has a South Korean Identity number, you can access the latest firmware directly from <a href="http://www.yepp.co.kr/">http://www.yepp.co.kr/</a>. The ID number is necessary for signing in).</p>

	<h4>Instructions</h4>

	<p style="color:black;background-color:yellow;">Please see the warnings above and the comments at the bottom. As with any hack, there is a chance that you will not succeed and that your machine will become useless. <strong>Do not attempt this if you are not prepared to accept failure!</strong></p>

	<ol>
		<li>On a windows computer, extract <code>tcctool-win32.zip</code> to a new folder on your Desktop</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, add the new tcctools directory to your path, or, copy the file <code>tcctool.exe</code> from the new directory to <code>c:\windows\system32\</code>.</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, extract the 4.03 firmware to a directory on your desktop</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, copy the files <code>YPK3.rom</code> and <code>YPK3.IMG</code> to your root directory (<code>c:\</code>)</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, plug the K3 into the computer via the <span class="caps">USB</span> cable</li>
		<li>Set your K3 to Recovery Mode
	<ol>
		<li>Slide the power button down (in the direction opposite the arrow) as if you were turning the K3 on.</li>
		<li>While holding the power button in the on position, use a paperclip or tooth pick to press the reset button on the back of the K3.</li>
		<li>You will hear (and see) Windows recognise the K3 as a new hardware device.</li>
	</ol></li>
		<li>On a windows computer, in the New Hardware window choose manual installation of drivers (depending on your system this may involve several steps).</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, when you are allowed to browse for drivers, browse to the tcctool folder you just extracted to your desktop. When an .inf file is selected, click next. This installs the tcctool drivers on your k3.</li>
		<li>Boot the K3 in recovery mode using the new firmware by running the following command from the command line (Start>Run): <code>tcctool -d ypk3 c:\YPK3.rom</code></li>
		<li>You will see the Samsung Logo and the K3 will indicate that it is installing the necessary firmware and disk image. <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Since February 2009, many people have been reporting that the device hangs irrecoverably at this point. See the comments below and be warned!</strong></span>.</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, using Windows Explorer, locate and open the K3&#8217;s disc. Format the disk as FAT32 if you are asked and accept all defaults.</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, once your K3 is formatted, use Windows Explorer to copy the 4.03 firmware you stored in <code>c:\</code> to the root (i.e. top level) folder of your K3.</li>
		<li>Set your K3 into recovery mode again by holding the on-switch and pressing reset.</li>
		<li>On a windows computer, boot the device again using from Start/run using the command <code>tcctool -d ypk3 c:\YPK3.rom</code>. </li>
		<li><strong>Important</strong>: On the screen of your K3 you will see a ball and then the Samsung Logo. <em><strong>Pull out the <span class="caps">USB</span> cable from your K3 as soon as the Samsung Logo appears</strong></em>.</li>
		<li>If you were able to do this, the K3 will permanently install the new firmware. If you are too late pulling the <span class="caps">USB</span> cable, you&#8217;ll need to start all over again.</li>
		<li>Once the K3 has installed the new firmware, it will turn off. You can now update the firmware to later versions of the 4.xx series using the windows executables supplied by Samsung.</li>
		<li>Your K3 is now a <span class="caps">USB</span> Mass Storage Device that can be connected to computers running any operating system just like any other flash drive: you can add new music files to it by dragging and dropping them on the K3&#8217;s music folder; and you can now play your <span class="caps">VORBIS</span> files. As added bonuses, you have a better EQ utility on your K3 and an additional text file viewer.</li>

	<p>Hallo Daniel Paul.<br />
I have some questions for you.<br />
1. After upgrade to firmware 4.03 do you have work FM radio ?<br />
I flash my yp-k3jab/xee from 3.05 to 4.10 and FM Radio was lost :(<br />
2. What type of 4.03 firm ware do you use ?</p>


</li>

	<p>1. Yes, I have FM Radio. As far as I can tell nothing is broken on my machine (I&#8217;ve not tried the picture gallery, though it claims it is there), and I acquired a new utility, &#8220;Text.&#8221; But remember, I went from 4.03 right through to 4.06.</p>

	<p>2. I used the 4.03 firmware at the <span class="caps">URL</span> listed above. http://www.yepp.co.kr/support/support_file_down_sms.jsp?pds_num=1665&#38;seq_num=1</p>

	<p>Hi, I followed all the steps but, tho is working, the screen turns to white and can only move through the menus by my imagination. Windows is now not allowing me to start the procedure again, does not recognize the device as <span class="caps">USB</span> and do not allow new formating. What can I do? I normally use Linux (Ubuntu), but the device is not visible in Linux</p>


</li>
<li><seg class="small"><strong>dan (Mon Sep 15, 2008 (10:38:30)) <a href="unlocking-the-samsung-yp-k3j-for-use-with-as-a-usb-mass-storage-device-with-ogg-vorbis-support.html#c000613" id="c000613">[PermLink]</a>:</strong></seg>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know the answer to this. When I did my research on the issue, the only problems people reported were missing pulling the plug out as it rebooted. And the answer to that was to repeat the steps. All examples of even quite bricked devices seemed to restore from repeating.</p>

	<p>The fact that windows is not seeing it as <span class="caps">USB</span> and that it isn&#8217;t working in linux means that it has not been turned into a mass storage device, <span class="caps">AFAIK</span>. Is it being recognised as an MP3 player? Also what firmware did you start with and do you now have?</p>

	<p>Dan,<br />
Many thanks for your help. Yes, it works as an MP3 and can use the radio as well. For sure I have done something wrong, but I followed the steps and cannot figure out what was wrong. Bad luck I seem to be the only one messing up the device</p>

	<p>I looked around again. People who had players that weren&#8217;t recognised by windows &#8216;as is&#8217; (either before or after) seem to have been able to get things going again using the TCTools utilities. Have you tried starting at step 0 again and using it?</p>

	<p>I think the first problem comes from the driver that is not allowing windows to format and start again. How can I get rid of this without reinstalling windows?</p>

	<p>Don&#8217;t know. If you mean the Samsung driver, then I think it is TCCTools you need to start with again. But if the issue is with TCCTools, then I don&#8217;t know at all, since I just downloaded and used it.</p>

	<p>Hi Dan. I have been lucky: bored of been unable to solve the problem, I went to the dealer and after trying to update the software without success he decided to replace my K3 without asking! Firmware is 3.09 WA JN. Well, if someone discloses what is going on and how to solve it, I may try again.</p>

	<p>Hi.  I&#8217;m the author of tcctool and glad you&#8217;ve found an unintended use for it &#8211; it was written to help port the Rockbox open source firmware to devices using the same <span class="caps">CPU</span> as your Samsung.</p>

	<p>tcctool works fine in Linux (and anywhere else libusb runs, including OS X), you just need to download and compile the source yourself &#8211; available via the Rockbox svn repository (in utils/tcctool/).</p>

	<p>See http://www.rockbox.org for more info about Rockbox.</p>

	<p>To checkout and compile the tcctool source, do:</p>

	<p>svn co svn://svn.rockbox.org/rockbox/trunk/utils/tcctool tcctool<br />
cd tcctool<br />
make</p>

	<p>You need libusb (and headers &#8211; i.e. the libusb-dev package) installed.</p>

	<p>My firmware was 3.05, and I bought the machine in Australia. I&#8217;ll go back to the dealer too and hope for the best. In any case, many thanks for your initiative Dan, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find a way to make it work somehow. Cheers.</p>

	<p>Nice tut. I tried it and after I pulled out the usb in the final stage (before the logo comes on) it says &#8220;not enough DB. please delete more than 18 mb&#8221; or something like that o_O. i dont understand. where is the problem, there 3.5gb of free space on it. o and another thing, when I try to start over again (step 7), my windows box either doesnt recognize the device or installs driver anyway on in making it impossible for me to chose the directory to install the driver. I tried uninstalling and installing but it said &#8220;cant find drivers that are latest then the ones that are already install&#8221; or something along the lines. Anyway sorry for the babbling, nice tut. I hope it had worked for me, but i still wont give up I&#8217;ll try again until i succeed</p>

	<p>Hey Alex, sorry to hear about it. People seem to be having really mixed results for the last six months to a year, which is when I started adding the warnings. I don&#8217;t what the issue is: with me, I did mess it up once, but I was able to redo it all without any problems. Some people report that they can, other report that things brick. I&#8217;ve no idea if it is different interpretations of the instructions here or different firmware floating around.</p>

	<p>Let us know here if you find an answer.</p>

	<p>Actually, Alex, as I was adding additional wrnings I just thought of something: did you try going on to step 11? It has been a long time since I reflashed by own device, but I don&#8217;t say that you are to wait for something to end at step 10, only that it starts moving the stuff over. Maybe if you go on to step 11 and open the device up in your windows machine, you can continue?</p>

	<p>Just a guess. Since many people are hanging here and yet others are making it through, I wonder if the distinction is that some just move on to step 11 and others get stuck waiting for step 10 to stop. <strong>This is not a claim or a guarantee that going on will solve things</strong>. Everybody using these instructions is doing so at their own risk.</p>

	<p>..Awsome!...<br />
I bricked my yp-k3 and was about to give up!. But luckily I found this! ..Oddly instead of using firmware 4.03 (as in your guide) I used 4.10 that&#8217;s right <span class="caps">FOUR</span> <span class="caps">POINT</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">ZERO</span> (4.10) and it fully installed it (4.10) without having to do a second firmware upgrade!. worked Like a charm.

	<p>I don&#8217;t know where to get the YPK3.rom and image! Tried samsung sites and stuff but those are korean and I can&#8217;t surf through it.</p>

	<p>Pleaes give direct links to these files (upload if you can). Rapidshare would be good.</p>

	<p>But so far soo good i just need those files.</p>

	<p>Thanks!</p>

	<p>I used this technique to upgrade my 2007 built YP k3. worked like a charm. Thanks.</p>

	<p>I think new version of the hardware are ones who face trouble. Or simply not following instructions.</p>

	<p>Hi Roger, I wouldn&#8217;t have copies of the files: I used an old windows computer that has since been reformatted and single boots linux. I remember that they were hard to find, but I got them by googling around I think.</p>

	<p>Hi Pal,</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t want to say that people aren&#8217;t following the instructions correctly, though they are very finicky, and, given the mixed results, that may explain things.</p>

	<p>But it is also quite possible that Samsung is not sending identical firmware/hardware versions to all the markets.</p>

	<p>Either way, it is clear that it doesn&#8217;t always work&#8212;either because the instructions are such that not everybody can follow them or because the machines are different sometimes.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s been less trouble since I added the big yellow and red warnings!</p>

	<p>#72 and #73: I also had problems at first; in the end I think it had to do with timing and I ultimately managed to pull the cord correctly—but it was a long time ago.</p>

	<p>I honestly don’t know what to make of the mixed success people have been having. I confess I suspect that the differential is how clear my instructions have appeared to the reader—perhaps my writing style is easier to understand for some people than others. But it could also be that there are different models out there or that Samsung has changed something somewhere.</p>

	<p>It’s not helpful, I know, but this is why the article is so heavily labelled with warning statements. It is clear that some people end up wrecking their player: it might be that somebody else could fix it for them; but as far as they are concerned, they aren’t able to use it any more after they try this. </p>

	<p>Clearly, this is something you should  try only if you can afford to fail.</p>

	<p>Could you let us know if you manage to solve the problem?</p>

	<p>i managed to find out why at point 10. some people have had problems with their player freeze &#8220;copying files.don&#8217;t unplug&#8220;or something like this.I waited a few minutes,and after that i went to device manager in windows and disabled the usb port in use with the player.After you disable,click enable&#8230;and voila! your player is recognized by the computer and you can continue with the next step</p>
